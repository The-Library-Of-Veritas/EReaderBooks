			"author": "Devon Price",
			"description": "For every visibly Autistic person you meet, there are countless “masked” Autistic people who pass as neurotypical. Masking is a common coping mechanism in which Autistic people hide their identifiably Autistic traits in order to fit in with societal norms, adopting a superficial personality at the expense of their mental health. This can include suppressing harmless stims, papering over communication challenges by presenting as unassuming and mild-mannered, and forcing themselves into situations that cause severe anxiety, all so they aren’t seen as needy or “odd.”",

			"author": "Alfred Archer",
			"description": "Is it appropriate to honour and admire people who have created great works of\nart, made important intellectual contributions, performed great sporting feats,\nor shaped the history of a nation if those people have also acted immorally?\nThis book provides a philosophical investigation of this important and timely\nquestion. The authors draw on the latest research from ethics, value theory,\nphilosophy of emotion, social philosophy, and social psychology to develop and\nsubstantiate arguments that have been made in the public debates about this\nissue. They offer a detailed analysis of the nature and ethics of honour and\nadmiration, and present reasons both in favour and against honouring and\nadmiring the immoral. They also take on the important matter of whether we can\nseparate the achievements of public figures from their immoral behaviour.\nUltimately, the authors reject a “one-size-fits-all” approach and argue that we\nmust weigh up the reasons for and against honouring and admiring in each\nparticular case. Honouring and Admiring the Immoral is written in an accessible\nstyle that shows how philosophy can engage with public debates about important\nethical issues. It will be of interest to scholars and students working in moral\nphilosophy, philosophy of emotion, and social philosophy.",

			"description": "For over 50 years, evaluators have used theories of change to articulate the\ncausal logic underpinning how an intervention is intended to bring about a\ndesired change. From its origins in programme evaluation, the approach has been\nadopted more widely for purposes from program design to program management. As\ntheories of change continue to be used for multiple purposes, it is an opportune\nmoment for the evaluation community—where the approach originated—to provide\ntheir perspective on the strengths and limitations of the approach and its\nfuture directions. To provide these perspectives, we asked nearly 30 of the\nworld’s leading evaluators and programme theorists to provide a short essay on\nthe past, present, and future of theories of change. This book presents their\ninsights organized into five main themes: the use of theories of change in\nbroader public policy contexts; using theories of change to establish causality;\ndeveloping theories of change reflective of multiple stakeholder perspectives;\nusing theories of change to understand wider societal change processes; and\napplying theories of change approaches for multiple purposes. By sharing these\ndiverse perspectives, the book aims to provide both evaluators and emerging\nprogram theorists with critical perspectives to inform future practice.",

Drawing together the experiences and expertise of\ndozens of scholars and practitioners from a variety of disciplines and\ngeographical contexts, the chapters in this collection examine the development,\ndeployment, and assessment of a workshop or workshop series. In the first\nsection, “Where?”, the authors seek to situate digital humanities workshops\nwithin local, regional, and national contexts. The second section, “Who?”,\nguides readers through questions of audience in relation to digital humanities\nworkshops. In the third and final section, “How?”, authors explore the mechanics\nof such workshops. Taken together, the chapters in this volume answer the\nimportant question: why are digital humanities workshops so important and what\nis their present and future role? Digital Humanities Workshops: Lessons Learned\nexamines a range of digital humanities workshops and highlights audiences,\nresources, and impact. This volume will appeal to academics, researchers, and\npostgraduate students, as well as professionals working in the DH field.",

The tax\ncode isn't computer code, but a series of complex formulas. It has\nvulnerabilities; we call them \"loopholes.\" We call exploits \"tax avoidance\nstrategies.\" And there is an entire industry of \"black hat\" hackers intent on\nfinding exploitable loopholes in the tax code. We call them accountants and tax\nattorneys.\n\nIn A Hacker's Mind, Bruce Schneier takes hacking out of the world of computing\nand uses it to analyze the systems that underpin our society: from tax laws to\nfinancial markets to politics.

It lays the foundation for a more systematic and\ninterconnected treatment of these central notions in epistemology. The author’s\nkey move is to show first that a specific conception of doxastic justification\nconstitutes our best point of entry into questions pertaining to a subject’s\nability to secure understanding of reality. Second, that the traditional order\nof analysis when it comes to the connection between understanding and knowledge\nshould be reversed: knowledge itself is best conceived of in terms of a specific\ntype of understanding.",

			"author": "Marquis, Nicolas",
			"description": "This edited collection investigates, from a sociological perspective, what it\nmeans to create an autonomous individual through a novel exploration of three\ncentral fields of sociology: education, mental health care, and parenting. By\nlinking these three aspects through their contribution to the building of an\nautonomous child, the volume analyses the intersecting roles of parent, teacher,\nand caregiver as well as the transformations in identities of child, pupil, and\npatient to understand the construction and repair of autonomy. Using a\ncomparison of various case studies across Scandinavian, English-speaking, and\nFrench-speaking countries, chapters explore why personal autonomy is so\nimportant in many societies and demonstrate the conceptual and practical\nchallenges the idea brings. Ultimately, the book provides an innovative\ncontribution to the fields of educational sociology and the philosophy of\neducation, as well as parenting studies and the sociology of mental health by\nmaking the case for taking autonomy, and its paradoxes, seriously. This\ncross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to scholars, researchers, and\npostgraduate students working in sociology and the philosophy of education,\nparenting, mental health, and child development more broadly. Those with a focus\non the study of individualistic societies will also find the volume of use.",

			"author": "Francesca Mezzenzana",
			"description": "In the aftermath of a global pandemic, amidst new and ongoing wars, genocide,\ninequality, and staggering ecological collapse, some in the public and political\narenas have argued that we are in desperate need of greater empathy – be this\nwith our neighbours, refugees, war victims, the vulnerable, or disappearing\nanimal and plant species. This interdisciplinary volume asks the crucial\nquestions: How does a better understanding of empathy contribute, if at all, to\nour understanding of others? How is it implicated in the ways we perceive,\nunderstand and constitute others as subjects? Conversations on Empathy examines\nhow empathy might be enacted and experienced – either as a way to highlight\nforms of otherness or, instead, to overcome what might otherwise appear to be\nirreducible differences. It explores the ways in which empathy enables us to\nunderstand, imagine, and create sameness and otherness in our everyday\nintersubjective encounters focusing on a varied range of “radical others” –\nothers who are perceived as being dramatically different from oneself. With a\nfocus on the importance of empathy to understand difference, the book contends\nthat the role of empathy is critical – now more than ever – for thinking about\nlocal and global challenges of interconnectedness, care and justice.",

			"description": "Adolescents in Humanitarian Crisis investigates the experiences of adolescents\ndisplaced by humanitarian crisis. The world is currently seeing unprecedented\nlevels of mass displacement, and almost half of the world’s 70 million displaced\npeople are children and adolescents under the age of 18. Displacement for\nadolescents comes with huge disruption to their education and employment\nprospects, as well as increased risks of poor psychosocial outcomes and sexual\nand gender-based violence for girls. Considering these intersectional\nvulnerabilities throughout, this book explores the experiences of adolescents\nfrom refugee, internally displaced persons and stateless communities in\nBangladesh, Ethiopia, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Rwanda. Drawing on\ninnovative mixed-methods research, the book investigates adolescent\ncapabilities, including education, health and nutrition, freedom from violence\nand bodily integrity, psychosocial wellbeing, voice and agency, and economic\nempowerment. Centring the diverse voices and experiences of young people and\nfocusing on how policy and programming can be meaningfully improved, this book\nwill be a vital guide for humanitarian students and researchers, and for\npractitioners seeking to build effective, evidence-based policy.",

			"description": "This book examines the practices of contesting evidence in democratically\nconstituted knowledge societies. It provides a multifaceted view of the\nprocesses and conditions of evidence criticism and how they determine the\ndynamics of de- and re-stabilization of evidence. Evidence is an essential\nresource for establishing claims of validity, resolving conflicts, and\nlegitimizing decisions. In recent times, however, evidence is being contested\nwith increasing frequency. Such contestations vary in form and severity – from\nquestioning the interpretation of data or the methodological soundness of\nstudies to accusations of evidence fabrication. The contributors to this volume\nexplore which actors, for what reasons and to what effect, question evidence in\nfields such as the biological, environmental and health sciences. In addition to\nactors inside academia, they examine the roles of various other players,\nincluding citizen scientists, counter-experts, journalists, patients, consumers\nand activists. The contributors tackle questions of how disagreements are framed\nand how they are used to promote vested interests. By drawing on methodological\nand theoretical approaches from a wide range of fields, this book provides a\nmuch-needed perspective on how evidence criticism influences the development and\nstate of knowledge societies and their political condition. Evidence\nContestation will appeal to scholars and advanced students working in philosophy\nof science, epistemology, bioethics, science and technology studies, the history\nof science and technology and science communication.",

			"description": "This fascinating new book examines diversity in moral judgments, drawing on\nrecent work in social, personality, and evolutionary psychology, reviewing the\nfactors that influence the moral judgments people make. Why do reasonable people\nso often disagree when drawing distinctions between what is morally right and\nwrong? Even when individuals agree in their moral pronouncements, they may\nemploy different standards, different comparative processes, or entirely\ndisparate criteria in their judgments. Examining the sources of this variety,\nthe author expertly explores morality using ethics position theory, alongside\nother theoretical perspectives in moral psychology, and shows how it can relate\nto contemporary social issues from abortion to premarital sex to human rights.\nAlso featuring a chapter on applied contexts, using the theory of ethics\npositions to gain insights into the moral choices and actions of individuals,\ngroups, and organizations in educational, research, political, medical, and\nbusiness settings, the book offers answers that apply across individuals,\ncommunities, and cultures. Investigating the relationship between people’s\npersonal moral philosophies and their ethical thoughts, emotions, and actions,\nthis is fascinating reading for students and academics from psychology and\nphilosophy and anyone interested in morality and ethics.",
