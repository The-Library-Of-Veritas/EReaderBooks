			"content": "Acknowledgements\n\nMy parents, Kanakambika Antherjanam and Vishnu Namboodiri, were my first teachers. From them, I learnt to persevere, and to stay detached. This book would not have been possible without these fundamental lessons.\n\nI was introduced to the traditions discussed in this work through the poems and plays of the leading Kannada playwright, H.S. Shivaprakash. Discussions with him, and with three other prominent Kannada litterateurs, the late U.R. Ananthamurthy, the late Shantarasa, and Keshava Malagi, have provided insights that were otherwise not available in most academic studies on religious life in South Asia. Although their thoughts were framed by the popular academic equations of religion, caste, class, political authority, the ascetic ideal, and the ethical life, they brought to bear upon their understanding, the significant questions of creativity and performance, which presented these traditions in an altogether different light. I owe them a debt of gratitude.\n\nNo less rewarding were my engagements with many a saint of our times. Svami Vinaya Chaitanya, Guru Nirmalananda, Shaikh Riyaz-ud-din Chisti, and Svami Vimala Sarasvati enriched my thoughts with their strikingly original assessment of vedantic, Sufi and Buddhist cosmologies, and their sympathetic appreciation of modern European thought from Descartes and Spinoza to Wittgenstein and Bergson. I must also record my debt, although intellectually less rewarding, to the late Fakira Channavira Svami IV and Fakira Siddharama Svami V of the Shirahatti Matha, the late Puttaraja Gavayi of the Viresvara Punyasrama in Gadaga, Sivalingesvara Kumarendra Svami of the Savalagi Matha, Sivaratri Desikendra Svami of the Sutturu Matha, Sivamurti Murugha Sarana of the Murugharajendra Matha, Chitradurga, Bharati Tirtha Svami, the Sankaracharya of Sringeri, Visvesa Tirtha Svami of the Pejavara Matha, Udupi, Virabhadra Channamalla Svami of the Nidumamidi Matha, Bagepalli, and Saranabasavappa Appa of the Saranabasavesvara Matha, Kalaburagi.\n\nMuch of what I have to say about the political economy in the pages that follow springs from stimulating discussions I had with Y. Subbarayalu, with whom I often agree, and K.N. Ganesh, whose positions I all too often don’t share. For a long time, my understanding of religious traditions and practices in Karnataka was primitive and dogmatic, due, in large part, to the influence of counter-intuitive theories of religion propounded by a range of scholars from James George Frazer and William James to Clifford Geertz and Talal Asad. The late M.M. Kalburgi drew me out of the slumber of theory, threw me into the rather-hostile terrain which this book explores, and helped me acclimatize to this brave old world. Conversations with Romila Thapar, Bhairabi Prasad Sahu, the late Ram Sharan Sharma, Uma Chakravarti, Vijaya Ramaswamy, Rajan Gurukkal, S. Settar, M.G.S. Narayanan, B. Surendra Rao, Kumkum Roy, and Chetan Singh, at various times, have been of considerable help. More personal, although no-less intellectual, are my debts to Kunal Chakrabarti, who has always been encouraging, and R. Mahalakshmi and Shonaleeka Kaul, constant sources of inspiration. I have also benefitted from the conversations I had with Surya Prakash Upadhyaya and Ashok Kumar M., colleagues at the Institute where I teach.\n\nI have not had the privilege of meeting Sheldon Pollock, but the email conversations which we shared have opened up for me new and stimulating ways of engaging with premodern South Asia; nor have I had the privilege of meeting David Shulman (although we are working together on a joint project!). My telephone and Skype conversations with him and the exchange of emails have enabled me to think beyond the accepted frontiers of my discipline. I regret that I have known him only for two and a half years.\n\nAs usual, it was Kesavan Veluthat and Abhilash Malayil who had to bear the burden of prolonged discussions on almost every theme discussed in this book. They listened to me with patience for hours and hours every week, and made interventions that were crucial in developing my arguments. They have been my greatest teachers in history (although the latter is now masquerading as my student).\n\nAlthough this book was in the cards for a long time, I sat down in earnest to work on it only after Ishita Banerjee-Dube urged me to do so on more than one occasion. But for her, this work would have remained in cold storage for many more years. Thank you very much, Ishita-di.\n\nThanks also to Katarzyna Tempczyk, Managing Editor of Theology and Religious Studies in De Gruyter Open, who waited for the manuscript with kind patience, when I failed to meet the deadline; and to Wayne Smith, the Language Editor, whose efforts have enhanced the book’s readability to a substantial degree.\n\nThe innocent questions of H.G. Rajesh have been the most difficult to answer. I am indebted to him. I also thank him for accompanying me on a 3000-kilometre tour of Karnataka and southern Maharashtra in early August 2015, when I set out to have one last glimpse of the great landscapes and centres of monasticism discussed in this work, before sending it to print. A similar journey with Gil Ben-Herut in late June 2014 is unforgettable not only for the discoveries we jointly made, but also for the stimulating discussions that we had as we travelled from Bīdara, Basavakalyāṇa and Kalaburagi to Kāginele, Abbalūru and Harihara.\n\nPart of the research that went into the making of this book was carried out with fellowships from the Department of Culture, Government of India (in 2005), and the India Foundation for the Arts, Bangalore (in 2006), and a joint research project, funded by the University Grants Commission of India and the Israel Science Foundation (in 2014). I thank these funding agencies. S.K. Aruni and Sangappa Karjagi of the Indian Council of Historical Research, Southern Regional Centre, Bangalore, Vasanta Gowda of Mythic Society Library, Bangalore, and R.F. Desai of Basava Samithi Library, Bangalore, were always helpful, when I approached them for books, books and more books.\n\nM.S. Pramod and K.P. Pradip Kumar have been great sources of encouragement for the last two decades. Manorama Tripathy, Gayatri Deshpande, and Prabodh Kumar have stood by me in times of need. Aneish P. Rajan, Ameet Parameswaran, Arathi P.M., Sreejith Divakaran, Ancy Bay, Divya K., and K.D. Pradeep have been great pillars of support. The warmth of Shail Shankar, Kavita Pandey, and Suman has been invaluable in my life as a teacher in a sleepy town in the Himalayas. Shail and Kavita provided the much-needed respites, and the smile of their wonderful little son, threeyear old Cheeku (Akshat Mishra), added colours to it that I can scarcely forget.\n\nThis book was completed at 8:30 am on 30 August 2015 in Bhubaneswar. Fifteen minutes later, at Dharwad in northwestern Karnataka, two young men shot dead Professor M.M. Kalburgi, the greatest authority of our times on premodern religion, language, and literature in Karnataka. It was as if he stood by me like a guardian angel while the book was being written, and left immediately after the work was accomplished. I weep in silence."

			"title": "1 Introduction",
			"content": "1 Introduction\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century, a new religious consciousness began to take shape in the Indian subcontinent. This was the great Hindu consciousness. It was a phenomenon that was at once passionate and compassionate, egalitarian and divisive, benevolent and virile. With a checkered, sensitive history, it has pervaded religious life in India ever since, integrating and dividing millions of Indians in its own ambivalent ways. Historians trace the origins of the Hindu consciousness to the late eighteenth century, when the scholarly study of Indian religious texts such as the Vēdas, the Upaniṣads, and the Bhagavadgīta commenced under the aegis of the Asiatic Society, established in Calcutta by Sir William Jones in 1784, but it was not until the early decades of the nineteenth century that it was used as a marker of identity. Raja Rammohan Roy is credited with the use of the word ‘Hinduism’ for the first time. Roy used the word in one of his writings in 1816, and again, in 1817.1 It came into circulation almost immediately. At least one use of the word is known from 1818, and one from 1820, the latter in the Asiatick Researches.2 By 1839, the word had already appeared in the title of a book, Alexander Duff’s India and Indian Missions: Sketches of the Gigantic System of Hinduism Both in Theory and Practice.3 Duff spoke, among other things, of the theory of Hinduism,4 the origin of Hinduism,5 the system of Hinduism,6 and even the territory of Hinduism.7 In fact, the use of the word ‘Hindu’ as a marker of identity was already known by the time Rammohan Roy spoke of ‘Hinduism’ as a religion. In the first volume of the History of British India, published in 1817, James Mill used phrases such as the Hindu religion,8 the Hindu system,9 Hindu expressions and beliefs,10 Hindu ideas,11 the Hindu doctrine,12 the Hindu character,13 the Hindu law14 and the Hindu society,15 — all expressions in which the notion of Hinduism as an identity was manifestly embedded. However, for many years, the reach of the expressions Hindu and Hinduism was limited to scholarly debates and descriptions. Their scope as markers of identity was only feebly felt. Those who identified themselves as practicing Hindus were few in number. As the later half of the nineteenth century progressed, literate men and women in the leading metropolises of India were beginning, in increasing numbers, to speak of a religion called Hinduism to which they belonged. By the turn of the century, it had evolved into one of the most compelling historical realities of our times. So captivating was its impact that when the first World’s Parliament of Religions was held in Chicago in 1893, its organizers identified Hinduism as one of the religions to be offered a platform. By this time, Hinduism was already being represented as the oldest religion in the world. Among its representatives at the Parliament in Chicago was the redoubtable Swami Vivekananda. On 11 September 1893, he thanked the “Sisters and Brothers of America” for the warm and cordial welcome they had accorded, and said: “I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the world; I thank you in the name of the mother of religions”.16 On 19 September, he opined in his address to the Parliament that Hinduism was one of the three religions of the world that have come down from prehistoric times, the other two being Zoroastrianism and Judaism.17 Things evolved very quickly in the following years. In 1906, a Hindu Sahayak Sabha was formed in Lahore. On 4 August that year, Lala Lajpat Rai, Shadi Lal, Harkrishna Lal, Raja Narendra Nath, Ram Saran Das, Ruchi Ram Sahini, Ram Bhaj Datta, and Lala Hans Raj established a Hindu Sabha in the same city.18 In 1915, an ‘All India’ organization called the Sarvadeshak Hindu Mahasabha was launched to protect the interest of the Hindus. The organization was renamed Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha in 1921.19 The trajectory of evolution was rather spectacular.\n\nHow was Hinduism produced in the nineteenth century? Much ink has been expended in addressing this question over the last three decades. Attempts to explain Hinduism’s emergence in the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries are regarded as constructionist, as they proceed from the premise that Hinduism was constructed during the colonial period under British influence, if not under British patronage or supervision. Constructionism encapsulates several different positions. Some of them deny the very existence of Hinduism. Robert E. Frykenberg, for instance, holds that “there has never been any such thing as a single ‘Hinduism’ or any single ‘Hindu community’ for all of India”.20 More scathing is John Stratton Hawley’s observation that Hinduism “is a notoriously illegitimate child”.21 It is worth quoting Hawley at some length as it exemplifies this strand of constructionism.\n\nHinduism—the word, and perhaps the reality too—was born in the 19th century, a notoriously illegitimate child. The father was middle-class and British, and the mother, of course, was India. The circumstances of the conception are not altogether clear. One heard of the “goodly habits and observances of Hindooism” in a Bengali-English grammar written in 1829, and the Reverend William Tennant had spoken of “the Hindoo system” in a book on Indian manners and history written at the beginning of the century. Yet it was not until the inexpensive handbook Hinduism was published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in 1877 that the term came into general English usage.22\n\nOther positions are more cautions; thus, Christopher John Fuller writes:\n\n“Hinduism” as a term for that indigenous religion, became current in English in the early nineteenth century and was coined to label an “ism” that was itself partly a product of western orientalist thought, which (mis)constructed Hinduism on the model of occidental religions, particularly Christianity…. That linguistic development significantly reflects the impact of modern Hindu reformist thought and the Hindus’ own search for an identifiable, unitary system of religious belief and practice. Nonetheless, “Hinduism” does translate any premodern Indian word without serious semantic distortion, and it still does not correspond to any concept or category that belongs to the thinking of a large proportion of the ordinary people…. Yet that is not a decisive objection against employment of the term…. That “Hinduism” is not a traditional, indigenous category, concept, or “cultural reality”—albeit an important negative fact—in no way nullifies an analysis that demonstrates that Hinduism is a relatively coherent and distinctive religious system founded on common structures of relationships.23\n\nMore often than not, the constructionist position has held that Hinduism was invented by the British in the nineteenth century. J. Laine, an early constructionist, does not share this position fully. Writes Laine:\n\nthe concepts ‘Hinduism’ and ‘religion’ were part of the intellectual baggage packed off to India with the eighteenth century British, and with their introduction into Indian thought, Indians themselves used these terms in their efforts at self-definition and understanding vis-à-vis the alien Englishmen. Even if the categories did not quite fit, the process of cultural translation thus sparked by the need for self-understanding necessitated their use.24\n\nArguments against the British invention thesis are also made by Brian K. Pennington, who holds that it “grants altogether too much power to colonialism; it both mystifies and magnifies colonial means of domination and erases Hindu agency and creativity”.25 Pennington also rejects the view that the construction of Hinduism was carried out by reformers like Raja Rammohan Roy. In his view, popular Hinduism was ‘manufactured’ by initiatives that were opposed to both the colonial and the reformist projects. The early nineteenth-century Bengali newspaper, Samācār Candrikā, is identified as one such initiative. As far as the likes of the Samācār Candrikā are concerned,\n\nthe phrase (“construction of Hinduism”) has broader implications, describing not only representational practices but also the manipulations of ritual, belief, and their rationale that helped produce a cohesive Hinduism in tune with its multiethnic, multireligious colonial environment…. Manufacturing this Hinduism proved to be an act less of promoting particular items of doctrine or sites of authority—a strategy pursued especially by the Hindu reformer Rammohan Roy and is religious organization the Brahmo Samaj—and more of patterning a general structure for Hindu action, social and ritual.26\n\nThe constructionist position has not gone unchallenged. The absence of the word Hinduism before the nineteenth century, it is argued, is no proof of the absence of what the word might represent. In David N. Lorenzen’s assessment, “the claim that Hinduism was invented or constructed by European colonizers, mostly British, sometime after 1800 is false”27 because “textual evidence against this claim is so overwhelming”.28\n\nMajor historical changes in the economic and political institutions of India during the TurcoAfghan conquest, the Mughal invasion, the consolidation of the Mughal polity, and the establishment of the British colonial regime undoubtedly effected important changes in the religious traditions of India, but the rapid changes of early colonial times never had such an overwhelming impact that they led to the construction or invention of Hinduism. Hinduism wasn’t invented sometime after 1800, or even around the time of the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. What did happen during the centuries of rule by dynasties led by Muslim Sultans and Emperors was that Hindus developed a consciousness of a shared religious identity based on the loose family resemblances of variegated beliefs and practices of Hindus, whatever their sect, caste, chosen deity, or theological school.29\n\nWe may call this the primordialist position, although this view is by no means oblivious to the changes brought about by historical developments of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. While acknowledging the extensive nature of the changes that Hinduism underwent during the colonial period, it argues that Hinduism existed in India long before the arrival of the British. Thus, according to Thomas R. Trautmann,\n\nthere are a number of good reasons to be wary of saying that the British invented Hinduism. Many of the elements of the way in which Hinduism is constructed by the British in the period of Indomania derive from Indians and Indian sources…. The very (Persian) word Hindu for an inhabitant of India and follower of a certain religion shows that the conception predated British contacts with India. In any case the British conception of Hinduism as the religion of the natives of India is well along in its development in the seventeenth century, when Henry Lord wrote an account of what we would recognize as Hinduism…. To adopt the view that the British had no conception of Hinduism before the new Orientalism…would be to fall in with the propaganda of its own authority claims.30\n\nA leading Indologist who shares the primordialist thesis on Hinduism is Wendy Doniger. Her unjustly controversial work, The Hindus: An Alternative History, which gives an account of the ‘the Hindus’, begins the story thus:\n\nOnce upon a time, about 50 million years ago, a triangular plate of land, moving fast (for a continent), broke off from Madagascar (a large island lying off the southeastern coast of Africa) and, “adrift on the earth’s mantle,” sailed across the Indian Ocean and smashed into the belly of Central Asia with such force that it squeezed the earth five miles up into the skies to form the Himalayan range and fused with Central Asia to become the India subcontinent…. This prehistoric episode will serve us simultaneously as a metaphor for the way that Hinduism through the ages constantly absorbed immigrant people and ideas and as the first historical instance of such an actual immigration.31\n\nThe section where these words occur is entitled “Origins: Out of Africa”. If the present writer was to attempt a history of the landmass we now call India, it would in all likelihood commence on a similar note. Only that it would not be called a history of the Hindus. Doniger makes her views clear in the opening piece of an anthology of essays “on Hinduism” in premodern India. “For the past few decades”, writes she,\n\nscholars have raised several and strong objections to the use of any single term to denote one of the world’s major and most ancient faiths. The name ‘Hinduism’ that we now use is of recent and European construction. But it is Eurocentric to assume that when Europeans made the name they made the game. ‘Hinduism’ (dare I use the ‘H’ word, and may I stop holding up my hands for mercy with quotation marks?) is, like the armadillo, part hedgehog, part tortoise. Yet there are armadillos, and they were there before they had names. I would like to suggest some ways in which the disparate parts of what we call Hinduism have in fact existed for centuries, cheek by jowl, in a kind of fluid suspension.32\n\nShe goes on to note:\n\nIt is true that before the British began to categorize communities strictly by religion, few people in India defined themselves exclusively through their religious beliefs; their identities were segmented on the basis of locality, language, caste, occupation and sect. Even today…most people in the country would define themselves by allegiances other than their religion. There is, after all, no Hindu canon; ideas about all the major issues of faith and lifestyle—vegetarianism, nonviolence, belief in rebirth, even caste—are subjects of debate, not dogma. And yet, if we look carefully, there are shared ideas, practices and rituals that not only connect the diverse people generally called ‘Hindus’ today, but also link the people who composed and lived by the Vedas in northwest India around 1500 BCE with the Hare Krishna converts dancing in the streets of twenty-first-century New York.33\n\nThis, certainly, is not a piece of history a modern practitioner of the craft is expected to produce. The vaidic people who lived “in northwest India around 1500 BCE” were still not familiar with the use of iron, while the group of ill-informed dancers “in the streets of twenty-first-century New York” live at a time when a manned mission to Mars is being worked out. The nature of the relationship which the two share is by no means obvious. One wonders if this is a piece of ‘connected history’ writ large?34 As far as tracing the antiquity of Hinduism is concerned, this understanding of Hinduism is not qualitatively different from Zaehner’s 1962 work, which the Guardian praised as “the best short introduction to Hinduism in existence”.35 Zaehner’s Hinduism consisted of the Vēdas, Brahman, mōkṣa or liberation, god, dharma, and bhakti. It was, in other words, more of an intellectual history. Doniger’s concerns are almost altogether different, as she engages with a wide range of topics such as gods and goddesses, women and ogresses, violence and sacrifice, devotion and sex. In her ‘alternative’ history, which is richer in details, sharper in analysis, and oftentimes illuminating for its raw insights, even dogs, monkeys, and talking animals find respectful space. This is, truly, a story coming from a gifted chronicler of times at the height of her powers. Nevertheless, her Hinduism and that of Zaehner share the same template of primordialism.\n\nMost studies on Hinduism accept the fact that the term is hard to define. There are no prophets and no books acceptable to everyone, no single common deity worshipped by all practitioners. Yet, it is claimed that some essential features of Hinduism can indeed be identified ‘if we look carefully’. Exemplifying this position are these words of Gavin D. Flood:\n\nwhile it might not be possible to arrive at a watertight definition of Hinduism, this does not mean that the term is empty. There are clearly some kinds of practices, texts and beliefs which are central to the concept of being a ‘Hindu’, and there are others which are on the edges of Hinduism…. ‘Hinduism’ is not a category in the classical sense of an essence defined by certain properties, there are nevertheless prototypical forms of Hindu practice and belief.36\n\nThe differences between the constructionists and the primordialists have produced a body of writings that is rich in documentation and spirited in arguments. Yet, the cumulative light it sheds on how Hinduism was constructed, or transformed, is by no means remarkable. This is due in large to the fact that both groups approach Hinduism with an essentialist bent of mind. The ‘illegitimate child’ thesis of the constructionists seems to be suggesting that other religions like Islam and Christianity were not constructed, or that the construction would have been legitimate had it happened several centuries before the coming of the British (or the Muslims). It also naively presumes that a religion like Hinduism can be constructed with the help of a body of writings produced in the nineteenth century by the British, or by Indian reformers, or by counter-manoeuvres like the one the Samācār Candrikā has represented. In other words, it bestows undue determinism and autonomy on discourse. If it was discourse that created Hinduism, all we would need in order to undo it in our day is a counterdiscourse. The world, unfortunately, is ontological, not discursively constituted, as the present study will demonstrate.\n\nThe primordialist position, on the other hand, is often apologetic, and expressed in the form of statements that are easy to falsify.37 Its arguments are based largely on the fact that beliefs, practices, and texts identified as Hindu in the nineteenth century existed for several centuries before the arrival of the British. The occasional occurrence of the word Hindu, at least after the fourteenth century, in Indian sources is also taken as evidence for the existence of Hinduism before the colonial era. But the primordialists have failed to produce evidence to the effect that a Hindu universe was imagined before the nineteenth century in the same way as, for example, Christendom, the Islamicate, or the respective Buddhist, Jaina, Sikh, and Jewish worlds were imagined.\n\nThe essentialist approach of the constructionists and the primordialists takes religion as an always-already formed entity, with an essential core of its own. Changes caused by political, economic, and other factors are of course acknowledged and extensively discussed. That most aspects of religion, ranging from the institutional to the ritual, are subjected to transformation is also accepted. Even so, the insistence that there is an identifiable set of features inherent in a religion tends to essentialize the phenomenon. Essentialism, per se, is by no means undesirable. In fact, the identification of common traits, and their classification and categorization, constitutes one of the methods through which information is processed for the purpose of knowledge production. Essentialism is central to this mode of information processing.38 It is through this imperative that the structuring of knowledge, and the process of conceptualization through definitions and taxonomies, become possible. Thus, essentialism is characteristic of at least some forms of knowledge production. The problem with it begins to manifest when the approach is generalized in order to essentialize everything. This is also true of the urge to theorize that informs so much of our contemporary academic pursuits.\n\nToday, it is more-or-less an accepted maxim that theorizing is the only way of producing valid knowledge about the human world. The validity of the maxim itself has never been tested. It is assumed, for no sustainable reason, that knowledge production is contingent upon the production of theory. “Theories,” according to one definition, “are nets cast to catch what we call ‘the world’.”39 It has “promised the relief of new problems and new interests.”40 These are sober views, more in the nature of an apology rather than an argument for theory. Less temperate views exist. One of them, for instance, tells us that a theory enables us to “decide whether or not some newly discovered entity belongs to its domain”, and to assign domains through arbitration when such decision-making involves a conflict.41 Well? This means that theory is all about distinguishing an apple from an orange, an aircraft from a submarine, a Hindu from a Muslim, a Brahmin from a Dalit. Theory, then, is all about segregation, placing objects of inquiry in distinct, unique, and well-demarcated domains, where there are no possibilities of overlaps, exchanges, similarities or spillovers of any kind. Ensuring distinction and difference in their pristine forms is what this approach to theory is aimed at.\n\nThe urge to theorize every object of inquiry is in fact driven by the desire to endow everything with distinct and unalterable attributes of its own. It is a universal desire to particularize, to differentiate, to break up, and dismantle, and to assign to every object its own space or domain. When brought to the level of human beings, the message it sends out is too unambiguous to be missed. There are no shared experiences or shared histories, no common hopes and dreams, no common destinies either, no possibilities of realization, transformation, forgiveness, or redemption. It affirms and celebrates a life of self-assertion and chauvinism that nurtures indifference—if not intolerance and hatred—for the rest of the world.\n\nThe essentialism that lurks behind the theory-bug is not free from the effects of reification. It has its parallels in the unique-in-itself logic of the commodity produced by the capitalist praxis of production, and is, clearly, a classic instance of reification of the commodity logic. More dangerously, it is also in reified harmony with the rhetoric of ethnicity, caste, religion, separatism, hatred-nationalism, fundamentalism, and clash of civilizations, which are all governed by the same logic of uniqueness and ontological difference from the rest. What we see here is the infamous we-cannotlive-together mentality in a thoroughly reified, and therefore unconscious, form. It reminds us of Octavio Paz’s Mexican who “shuts himself off from the world: from life and from death.”42\n\nWe are not suggesting that difference is evil or that there are no differences in the world. The existence of difference is what necessitates theory in the first place. But the belief that theory alone can make knowledge possible results in either affirming difference where they may not really exist, or in undermining the presence or possibility of similarities, exchanges, interfaces, and overlaps between different objects. A theory of the market, as different from a theory of language or a theory of renunciation is understandable. But a theory of the market, distinct from a theory of money, commodity, trade, and inflation, can only offer us a tunnel vision of the market.\n\nThe moral of the above discussion is plain and simple: the production of knowledge is not at the mercy of theory. Theorizing as an academic enterprise has its palpable limits. Its possibilities are not endless or extendable to every object of inquiry. At the same time, these limits by no means exhaust the possibility of generating valid knowledge about the human world. Inquiries that do not culminate in a theory can be as fruitful, or even more meaningful, than the ones that do. The desire to theorize everything is not found to be springing from an examination of the possibility or otherwise of theorizing. It is an a priori position, governed by the processes of reification in the capitalist world of generalized commodity production. Its logic of uniqueness, distinction, and difference is also the one that informs the marketing of cars, cellphones, chocolates, and cigarettes on the one hand, and the passions that drive the rhetoric of ethnicities, religious fundamentalism, and clash of civilizations an the other.\n\nKarl Marx theorized capital. Ferdinand de Saussure and Sigmund Freud produced theories of language and the unconscious respectively, no matter how unconvincing they were. Not all objects of inquiry enjoy similar advantages. It is too early to say whether religion is open to theorizing or not. It follows, then, that the question of identifying the essential core of Hinduism—or any religion, for that matter—has not arisen.\n\nThis study is an attempt to trace a prehistory of Hinduism. The geographical limits and the select traditions chosen for analysis presuppose that it is a prehistory, and not the prehistory of Hinduism. Many such prehistories are possible, which differ in varying degrees in their details. The larger trajectory of historical development, though, is likely to be similar, if not identical, as it is intricately entwined with the trajectory of the political economy.\n\nOur study proceeds from the presumption that Hinduism was imagined and brought into existence in the course of the nineteenth century. To that extent, it shares one of the central premises of the constructionists that Hinduism is a new religion. Our starting point springs from the following historical considerations.\n\nWe have already noticed that the word Hinduism, or its variants in any Indian language, did not exist before the year 1816. Far more compelling is the fact brought to light by an analysis of the context in which the word Hindu figured in the sources before the nineteenth century. Let us look at two instances of the use of the expression occurring in sources from the region taken up for study in this work. One is from the corpus of Vijayanagara inscriptions. Here, the king of Haṃpi is identified as ‘Hindūrāya Suratrāṇa’ or ‘Hindūrāya Suratāḷu’. The expression may be roughly translated as “a Sultān among Hindu kings”.43 It is noteworthy that the word Hindu is placed in juxtaposition with an Islamic term, Sultān. It is not an autonomous or internally constituted marker of identity. In other words, the referent is elusive. A religious identity—like all identities—is by definition, relational, and therefore not altogether self-constituted. However, it has always been possible for Buddhism, Jainism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to produce self-descriptions without invoking the other. Such is not the case with the use of ‘Hindu’ in the Vijayanagara inscriptions. The second instance is from the Nandiyāgamalīle, the hagiography of the saint Koḍēkallu Basava that we will take up for discussion in chapter 4. Hindu occurs twice in this text. Both figure in the same scene of action, and in both cases, the word is placed in contradistinction with Musalmāna, i.e., Muslim. Koḍēkallu Basava has set out on a long journey, wearing a ‘Hindu’ footwear on one leg and a ‘Muslim’ footwear on the other. Towards the last leg of his journey in northern India, a group of curious interlocutors ask him why he wore different footwear on each leg. To this, the saint offers an explanation which they find convincing.44 The point to be noted is that Hindu has no independent or self constituted reference in this case too. It is a term that occurs as a relational expression, vis-à-vis Muslim. What the word contained or signified is, therefore, not clear to us in retrospect. Nowhere else in the text is Koḍēkallu Basava identified as a Hindu.\n\nThese two instances capture in a nutshell the manner in which Hindu as a marker of identity was deployed in the Deccan region before the nineteenth century. The use of the term from other parts of the Indian subcontinent follows this broad pattern. It occurs in a situation that warrants comparison with Islam. Where this is not the case, the expression signifies India as a geographical entity. The identification of Islam as a religion centered on the Korān and the Prophet, and as characterized by monotheism and opposition to idol worship, recurs constantly in the sources. This is clearly a selfdefinition of Islam, although practitioners consistently deviated from these norms by incorporating the worship of non-Islamic deities, polytheism, and adherence to tomb-worship into their everyday practices. Scholarly discussions are not duty-bound to accept such a self-definition as the essential constituent of Islam; for scholarly engagements are professionally obliged to ask why such self-definitions were arrived at, and not to take them at face value. Inasmuch as such self-definitions of Hinduism were never formulated before the nineteenth century, there arises the question why they were never attempted. Genuine scholarship must raise this question, rather than decrying the recent ‘invention’ of Hinduism, or making apologetic statements concerning the absence of Hinduism as a clearly-defined category before the nineteenth century.\n\nAn attempt is made in this study to understand a set of religious processes that unfurled between the eleventh and the nineteenth centuries in the Deccan region, especially in the present-day Karnataka, and partly, southern Maharashtra. The study is set against the backdrop of the changing nature of the political economy over these centuries, and how religious processes were constitutive of, or responded to, these changes. The foregrounding of class relations is central to this enterprise. Although it is now fashionable among a section of the academia to underrate the effects of class in the Indian context, and to foreground caste in its stead, our study will demonstrate why this view is misplaced.\n\nIt is generally presumed that religious identity is an essential component of the human world.45 Thus, discussions on early Indian religion use expressions like Buddhist, Jaina, vaidic or Brāhmaṇical, and so on, rather uncritically to refer to the religion of the communities concerned. Chapter 2 of this study demonstrates why this presumption is historically unfounded. It shows, through an examination of texts and inscriptions from the Deccan region, that religious identities were created as a result of formidable historical processes during the eleventh and the twelfth centuries. Chapter 3 discusses how a new religious orthodoxy emerged between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries in the Deccan region. This orthodoxy commenced in the early twelfth century with Rāmānuja, who offered an ingenious interpretation of vēdānta in his scheme of qualified monism (viśiṣṭādvaita). Rāmānuja’s system was profoundly influential, and its impress was felt in the systems developed by the pioneering dualist (dvaita) saint, Ānanda Tīrtha, and the leading exponent of monism (advaita), Vidyāraṇya. New religious forces in the fifteenth century, who were opposed to the tenets of advaita, dvaita, and viśiṣṭādvaita, were nonetheless influenced by them, and produced a rich body of exegetical works in the court of the Vijayanagara king, Dēvarāya II. Chapter 4 explores how these fifteenth-century projects and the changing class structure of the period paved way for innovative religious practices in the region by way of pioneering the establishment of new monastic institutions that were fundamentally different from the monasteries of the preceding centuries. It also examines how the new monasteries underwent further transformations in the course of the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Chapter 5 explores a great divergence in the practices of renunciation that began to unfold from the late fifteenth century. It explains how the divergence was governed by two diametrically opposite ethical paradigms produced by the political economy, one centering on the ethic of enterprise, and the other, on the ethic of complacency. Sainthood underwent tremendous transformations in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, paving way for the rise of stand-alone saints, who neither built monasteries nor were affiliated with any religious lineages. At the same time, existing monasteries expanded their portfolio to include a set of new initiatives that were crucial vis-à-vis programmes of the Christian missionaries. These processes are taken up for examination in chapter 6. The study concludes with an epilogue, which offers a prolegomenon for a fresh assessment of that great phenomenon of the nineteenth and twentieth-century religious history, called Hinduism.\n\n\n\n1 Lorenzen 2006: 3.\n\n2 Ibid.\n\n3 Ibid., 4.\n\n4 Duff 1840: 144.\n\n5 Ibid., 297.\n\n6 Ibid.\n\n7 Ibid., 603.\n\n8 Mill 2010: 264.\n\n9 Ibid., 171; 470.\n\n10 Ibid., 198.\n\n11 Ibid., 215.\n\n12 Ibid., 243.\n\n13 Ibid., 304.\n\n14 Ibid., 141, 156.\n\n15 Ibid., 171, 429.\n\n16 Paranjape 2015: 3.\n\n17 Ibid., 5.\n\n18 Bapu 2013: 16.

The geographic region identified for study, and the limited number of traditions of renunciation chosen for analysis, restrict its scope and details. It is not an exhaustive account of the traditions within the region either, as we have not said a word about many important religious centres such as Śrīraṅgapaṭṭaṇa, Mēlukōṭe, and Mantrālaya, or about influential saints such as Sarvajña, Sarpabhūṣaṇa Śivayōgi, and Kaḍakōḷada Maḍivāḷappa. Several other prehistories of Hinduism can indeed be written, both within the region and beyond. Such accounts have the potential to yield historical information that is as yet unknown to the Anglophone academia. They offer fresh perspectives and possibilities of understanding that are, to say the least, intriguing in their own strange ways. More importantly, they point to the intellectual limits of the existing historical, Indological, and anthropological scholarship concerning religious life in South Asia.\n\nIn the light of what the foregoing discussions tell us, we may venture to outline a frame of reference through which a fresh assessment of the development of Hinduism in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries can be carried out.\n\nThere are a number of focal points in the story told in the preceding chapters. Two of them are of decisive significance for understanding how Hinduism was constructed. The first is the saint, occurring in various guises to engender the ethics of enterprise and complacency. Religious life in premodern India tended to gravitate towards him—and, at times, her—to a considerable extent, although this was hardly the sole feature of religion, as far as its practitioners were concerned. The second point of focus is class relations, figuring largely on an occupational plane in the form of complex and deep-rooted relationships between the peasantry, the trading and artisan groups, and the political elites. What happens to these two focal points in the course of the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries is central to our understanding of the development of Hinduism.\n\nBefore entering into this discussion, an important aspect of the political economy of the preceding century, brought into relief in chapters 5 and 6, needs to be emphasized again. During the later half of the eighteenth century, the peasantry in the Deccan region faced large-scale dispossession from their traditional access to land due to extensive monetization of landed wealth. In a technical sense, this must be understood as an instance of alienation, involving a de facto dispossession from the means of production. Eighteenth century sources tell us that dispossession from land (and, therefore, from the means of production) led increasingly to slavery or bonded labour in its agrestic form. Classical economic theory, especially in its Marxist variant, identifies dispossession from the means of production as a central feature of the capitalist economy. We must, with a measure of caution, make an attempt to revise this position. For, instances of dispossession were fairly common in the Deccan region for well over a millennium before the eighteenth century, and had begun to occur on an increased scale after the sixteenth century. However, the dispossessed had the (inevitable) choice of taking to begging, or getting absorbed as slaves or bonded labour, both agrestic and domestic.567 One of the earliest examples of this kind comes from the story of Niṃbiyakka, narrated by Harihara in the late twelfth century. When Niṃbiyakka and her father lost all their possessions, they decided to take to begging. But modesty forbade them from begging in the place of their birth. So the two travelled to another city, where under the shelter of anonymity, they commenced a new life as beggars. Then came the worse, when the father was afflicted with a disease. With no other choice of survival available to them, the father urged Niṃbiyakka to save his life by becoming a tottu, a slave offering sexual services to her master.568 A dutiful daughter that she was, Niṃbiyakka promptly submitted.569 In the following centuries, tottus, slaves, and bonded labourers became a regular feature of the labour market. However, a new possibility had opened up by the eighteenth century. The dispossessed could become a stand-alone saint. Cidānanda Avadhūta, whom we have mentioned on a couple of occasions before, is an exemplar of this new possibility.\n\nCidānanda’s life is recounted in the Cidānandāvadhūta Cāritra, a hagiography by his disciple Ayyappa. According to this work, the Avadhūta is born Jhaṅkappa to the couple, Annamma and Lakṣmīpati, in the village of Hiriya Harivāṇa near Ādavāni. Following the partition of the family property among the brothers, Lakṣmīpati’s fortunes begin to decline. He moves to the village of Hebbāḷa near Gaṅgāvati with his wife and son to find work. Soon, Lakṣmīpati and Annamma pass away, and Jhaṅkappa is orphaned. He is raised by Paṃpakka, the daughter of a village functionary, Nāgappa.570 Within a few years, the boy is initiated into renunciation as Cidānanda. He travels widely, and becomes a master of haṭhayōga and rājayōga. He also turns out to be a poet of great merit. Among his works are the Dēvīpurāṇaṃ and the Jñānasindhu. Although his story resembles the accounts of earlier saints like Koḍēkallu Basava, Śirahaṭṭi Fakīrappa, Tinthiṇi Mōnappa, and Sāvaḷagi Śivaliṅga in its broad outlines, the differences are too significant to be overlooked. Firstly, Cidānanda is said to be the legitimate son of Annamma and Lakṣmīpati, and not a child conferred by a saint. Secondly, very little is said about the miracles he performed. Thirdly, Cidānanda built no monastery, nor did he identify with an existing one. He stood alone, dispossessed of land and family, encountering alienation in its stark form. Cidānanda was truly a stand-alone saint in its archetypal manifestation.\n\nIt was possible for the dispossessed to become a saint even in earlier times, as the life of Ānanda Tīrtha’s brother Viṣṇu Tīrtha in the thirteenth century suggests. This trend continued into the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Nīralakere Basavaliṅga was one such saint, who was sent to a monastery at a young age when his parents could not raise him due to poverty. An alternative possibility was to attach oneself to a monastery in some capacity or the other. This pattern is typified by the life of Bidanūru Gaṅgamma, who ended up in a monastery to become the mistress of its pontiff, who sired her son Kaḍakōḷada Maḍivāḷappa to the consternation of the town’s orthodoxy.571 However, the stand-alone saint, without a monastery to support him or her, was clearly a new development.\n\nIt was in this context of dispossession, disbanding of armies (discussed in chapter 6), and the rise of the stand-alone saint that a historically far-reaching development began to unfurl across different parts of South Asia in the nineteenth century. This was the genesis of a secular labour market. Under the aegis of Indian rulers and chiefs (who presided over the ‘princely states’) as well as under the British administration, initiatives were undertaken to set up schools, colleges, hospitals, industries like cotton mills, paper mills, and printing press, railway and telegraph lines, etc. The state was beginning to play an increasing role in the development and control of infrastructure such as roads, bridges, irrigational installations, and other public utilities on a scale hitherto unknown in the subcontinent’s history. The functioning of the state was thoroughly reorganized along modern bureaucratic lines. These developments led to the emergence of a new labour market that was secular in nature, and not determined by lineage, caste, and religion, at least in theory. In any case, the new labour market was not organized around principles of hereditary succession. The secular labour market, with its homogenizing abstract labour, was the cornerstone that eventually dismantled the old world and ushered in the new. The making of modern South Asia is generally attributed to forces like colonialism (and colonial modernity), nationalism, the arrival of the printing press, the great decennial census operations, introduction of modern education, and the development of newer forms of knowledge. None of these explanations appear to be persuasive. Modern South Asia was brought into existence by the secular labour market and its abstract labour, in the making of which colonialism and the other forces at best played roles of varying significance. We have seen that Śiśunāḷa Śarīf was a schoolteacher before becoming a saint. Aṣṭūru Narasappa Māstar and Hosapēṭeya Ayyappa Panthōji were also schoolteachers. Dēvadurgada Ādi Amāteppa was a revenue official of the Nizāṃ of Haidarābād, perhaps a member of the Nizāṃ’s Local Fund Committee. None of these positions was inherited.\n\nWith hereditary labour coming under increasing disfavour, the longstanding relationship between the inheritance of access to land on the one hand, and the inheritance of labour on the other, came to be liquidated. Simultaneously, and perhaps in consequence, absolute ownership of land with clearly defined, and legally sanctioned titles began to emerge as the norm. The prevailing practice of multiple tiers of control over land and multiple shades of access to its proceeds began to gradually wither away, culminating in the great land reforms of the later half of the twentieth century. The dissolution of the land-labour relationship also led to the weakening of the centrality once enjoyed by lineage groups (kula, vaṃśa, etc.); for the inheritance of land did not ensure inheritance of labour anymore. This is the reason why most South Asians today are able to remember their grandfather and some of his activities, and in many cases, recall at least the name of their great grandfather if not his acts, but have absolutely no knowledge about the generations preceding him. This is a far cry from the world brought to us by the inscriptions, literary works, and texts like the vaṃśāvalis and kaifiyats, where the acts of many generations in the family line are recorded. Modern South Asians have mastered the art of speaking about five thousand years of their nation’s past, but cannot trace the genealogy of their own families beyond their great grandfather!\n\nThe brāhmaṇas and the scribes were the most powerful groups that stood to benefit from this process. Two factors contributed to the advantageous position they enjoyed. One, in the predominantly illiterate world of South Asia, they had a neartotal monopoly over the use and abuse of writing. Two, they did not constitute castes in their own right, but were literacy-driven classes. Different group of castes with their own theories and practices represented the class of brāhmaṇas and scribes in their respective regions, so that the Mādhvas of coastal Karnataka had precious little to share with the Naṃbūdiris of Kerala, who in turn had few things in common with the Mohāpātras of Odisha or the Dēśpāṇḍes of Maharashtra. The Hinduism that was in the making served the class interests of these literate groups.\n\nThe new secular labour market did not gravitate towards a lineage group. Rather, it drew upon a community of the working class, so to speak. The identities which this class sought to forge were, therefore, not lineage based, but community oriented. The model for such a community was provided by the production relations governing the new urban working class, with its hierarchies, associations, cooperation, and divisions of labour. It is also likely that the British military cantonments of the nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries produced images of a close-knit, cohesive, and homogenizing community, which reinforced the idea of the community modelled after working class production relations. These developments made it possible for the idea of community-based identities to be gainfully articulated. This was how nationalisms and sub-nationalisms, in their secular, religious, ethnic, and linguistic variants, found expression in South Asia. And this was how caste, imagined as a community based on principles of endogamy and exogamy, came to be redefined as the central institution of the South Asian world. The great religious community of Hinduism was also created in this context of community-based identities.\n\nHow was Hinduism created? We may bring our study to a close by making a set of preliminary remarks that address this question. The theory and history of Hinduism, and its practice, were brought into existence by the upwardly mobile, literate, and mostly male intelligentsia of the nineteenth century. This intelligentsia consisted of the upper class and the white collared sections of the middle class. The lower class and the lower rungs of the middle class were not privy to this historical enterprise. The peasantry was also conspicuous by its absence.\n\nThis class character informed the histories of Hinduism that came to be written. It was a largely text-based history, in which religious works of antiquity in Sanskrit, like the Vēdas, the Upaniṣads, the Purāṇas, the Rāmāyaṇa, and the Mahābhārata, occupied the central place. Śaṅkara’s system of advaita became the theoretical fulcrum of this new religion. Hope, inaction, and prayer were its ideals. (Note that hope, inaction, and prayer in the form of petitioning were also the ideals of the Moderate phase of the Indian National Congress.) Knowledge sprang from the written word in its new guise as the printed book. This meant that the living saint as a repository of knowledge was no longer of any use. Thus, saints and their genealogies came to be sidelined in the histories of Hinduism. If the names of selected saints (such as Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Kabīr, and Tulsīdās) were regularly invoked, it was because they had allegedly gained a clear understanding of the ancient vaidic wisdom, or had fought against oppression and inequality that stained the otherwise spotless fabric of the wonder called Hinduism. Contrary to contemporary understandings concerning forms of secular knowledge, these histories did not understand ethics, morality, and spiritual knowledge as processes subject to change, revision, and rejection, but as eternally true revelations contained in the scriptures. This order of things did not warrant the presence of the living saint, for what the saint had to say was now made available in the printed book, the new repository of knowledge. Inasmuch as the focus was on knowledge and values, and not on labour or enterprise, the histories of Hinduism had no reason to provide space for the peasantry, who embodied labour and enterprise as substance as well as metaphor. Thus was created the foundations of a new religion, which cherished spiritual knowledge and values in their written form, and sidelined the ideals of labour and enterprise. In other words, Hinduism was created by the abolition of the saint and the peasant. This mode of representing Hinduism attained full-blown proportions in the twentieth century.\n\nAlienation from traditional access to land and profession had severe psychological implications. It created a deep sense of void, and lasting images of loss: loss of possession, belongingness, and meaning. Paradigms of self-awareness that were deeply engrained in the psyche for many centuries were overthrown by the secular labour market and the great anxieties and uncertainties it precipitated. Alienation was now absolute. With possibilities of exercising control over the means of production becoming a distant dream, a lasting sense of vacuum and victimization crept in. The new identities that came to be forged by the existential need for selfawareness were profoundly informed by this sense of victimization, and a craving for retributive justice. Nationhood was one such identity. Caste as a closed endogamous group was another. The making of Hinduism in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries was determined by the same existential imperative.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the earliest attempts to articulate Hinduism by the Indians were often made in response to Christian missionary initiatives. Advocates of Hinduism carried out spiteful propagandas against Christianity and its missionaries. The sense of void and victimization caused by being uprooted from the inheritance of access to land and profession shaped the modern Indian’s unconscious, and made alienation a defining feature of the modern individual. By a reified extension, a desire for retributive justice also became a necessary component of the unconscious. In its conscious forms of articulation, Christian missionaries appeared as the target of attack. Conscious attempts in this direction are too many and too familiar to be enumerated. However, inasmuch as alienation in general functioned unconsciously in the efforts to articulate Hinduism, one notices that grievances against the Christians were recorded even from the most unlikely quarters. Swami Vivekananda was among the tallest representatives and exponents of Hinduism in the nineteenth century. His eclectic approach to other religions is well known, as is his deep admiration for Christianity. Yet, he took time to make the following remarks at the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago:\n\nChristians must always be ready for good criticism, and I hardly think that you will mind if I make a little criticism. You Christians, who are so fond of sending out missionaries to save the soul of the heathen—why do you not try to save their bodies from starvation? In India, during the terrible famines, thousands died from hunger, yet you Christians did nothing. You erect churches all through India, but the crying evil in the East is not religion—they have religion enough—but it is bread that the suffering millions of burning India cry out for with parched throats. They ask us for bread, but we give them stones. It is an insult to a starving people to offer them religion; it is an insult to a starving man to teach him metaphysics. In India a priest that preached for money would lose caste and be spat upon by the people. I came here to seek aid for my impoverished people, and I fully realised how difficult it was to get help for heathens from Christians in a Christian land.572\n\nIn his Hinduism: Doctrine and Way of Life, C. Rajagopalachari, expressed his reverence for Christianity by alluding to how the modern world had moved away from its values.\n\nIt is indeed a miracle that earnest Christians preserve both their faith and their psychological health under the conditions of current national and international activities. The State permits, aids and abets the wholesale infringement of what is daily read and formally taught as the word of Christ. Yet, almost all the citizens of the State profess religion and believe themselves to be Christians. They duly celebrate Christian rites and festivals. The reign of relentless private competition, the right to make maximum private profit at the expense of others and the exploration of every advantage got by accident or acquired by enterprise, so that the differences between man and man may grow in geometric progression, are all plain denials of Christ.573\n\nYet, Rajagopalachari did not fail to express his grievance against Christian missionaries in India for the harm done to Hinduism.\n\nThe claim may to outsiders seem strange, especially to those whose knowledge of Hinduism has been derived from the information supplied by the Christian missionaries of an older generation. As we are not, however, living in the times of the proselytizing Christian missions whose one function was to show that Hinduism was good for nothing, it may be hoped that the claim made in this book will receive a fair examination at the hands of sincere thinkers.574\n\nThus, grievance and a sense of victimization were to be seen not only among the ideologues of Hindutva, like Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, but also among sober spokesmen of Hinduism, as exemplified by the critiques of Vivekananda and Rajaji.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Islam became the chief target against which the unconscious longing for retributive justice found its conscious expression. The rest— from the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 to the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, the Gujarat communal pogram of 2002, and the lynching that occurred at Dadri when these pages were being written—is history.\n\nThe making of Hinduism was not a smooth process, though. Action oriented themes were beginning to register their presence as early as the late nineteenth century in opposition to the advocacy of hope, inaction, and prayer. Representatives of this tendency—Swami Vivekananda, Dayananda Saraswati, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi—were to draw inspiration from the Bhagavadgītā. The Gītā itself was poorly understood, and continues to be so. But two of its sayings became great religious slogans: i) one has a right only over action, never over the fruits of action,575 and ii) I (Lord Kṛṣṇa) appear whenever dharma is debilitated and adharma triumphs; I return in every age to protect the virtuous, destroy the wicked, and establish dharma.576 Vivekananda was one of the earliest exponents of action-oriented Hinduism. The Arya Samaj, which the Hindu orthodoxy of the day strongly reproached, was another powerful advocate of action. The living saint had a substantial role to play in this alternative understanding of Hinduism. Nevertheless, his presence was not decisive or central to the process. Nor was his a monastic sainthood. There was no emphasis on the genealogies either. Against this backdrop emerged the Extremist faction of the Indian National Congress, which embodied a saintly countenance while at the same time advocating action. Tilak and Aurobindo were the trendsetters in this regard. Things changed remarkably when Gandhi took charge of the national movement. With him, the image of the saint (with a monastery, but without a lineage of teachers) became central once again. Gandhi brought his saintly image to bear upon the peasantry, whom the Moderates and the Extremists had consistently ignored. Only with the participation of the peasantry did the national movement attain the shape of a mass movement. In consequence, the rank and file of Hinduism expanded exponentially. The peasantry’s ethic of labour and action had to be incorporated into Hinduism now. It was not a one-way traffic though. The religious practices of the peasantry were substantially altered in the process. It is from this class character of Indian nationalism and its relationship with Hinduism that the source of tension between Gandhi on the one hand and the Extremists and the Hindu hardliners on the other arises.\n\nSimilar tensions mark the history of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the most important and influential organization of the Hindu orthodoxy. This is manifested in the deep differences between Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, who became the second chief (sarsanghchalak) of the RSS in 1940, and Madhukar Dattatreya Deoras, who succeeded him in 1973. Golwalkar was an advocate of ‘constructive work’, which included initiatives in community development, vocational training, and employment, the promotion of indigenous (dēśi) goods and products, and rescue and rehabilitation works in times of natural disasters, wars, and insurgency. Besides, it also involved training in martial art and self-defense in the śākhās, and establishing educational institutions where the curriculum was focused on ‘character building’ and the cultivation of a ‘Hindu national consciousness’. There was a battle to be waged against ‘enemies of the nation’—precisely the Muslims and the communists— but this was postponed to an indefinite future, to be realized in the fullness of time. The insider critic, Sanjeev Kelkar, aptly summarizes the message it sent out to the activist:\n\nIt offered them a target larger than their life but demanded only moderate sacrifice and moderate courage. It gave them a sense of power, of being together and being a part of an organisation. It gave them confidence to face the disadvantages in life at a time when India was poor, starved and had locked itself into a state of stasis. This brand of patriotism and heroism did not demand the courage of revolutionaries.577\n\nGolwalkar abjured publicity, rarely appeared before the media, and presented a saintly image that promoted his vision of ‘character building’. Deoras was sharply opposed to this order of things, and shared a very difficult relationship with Golwalkar. As soon as he took charge as sarsanghchalak, he worked out a new plan of action for the RSS. He insisted on direct political action, and appeared frequently in the media. The Anti Congress movement (or the JP movement) that was taking shape in the country in the early 1970s under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan, provided a platform for bringing the Hindu right into the political mainstream. In the course of the next two decades, the RSS succeeded in reaching out to the peasantry and the backward castes. Groups that had remained outside the fold of the Hinduism that arose in the late nineteenth century were now vigorously mobilized into the service of Hindu nationalism. The siddha monasteries became important loci of organizing Hindu activism and militancy at the local level.\n\nFrom the early 1980s, the Sangh Parivar began to address the question of Hinduness or Hindutva at the level of legends, symbolism, rituals, and everyday practices. Its intensity increased in the 1990s and the first fifteen years of the twentyfirst century. It involved many calculated strategies, measures, and initiatives. Devotion to Rāma, and reclaiming his place of birth, Ayōdhyā, as a sacred centre for all Hindus, was one such initiative, and by far the most scandalous of all. It found expression through Ramanand Sagar’s popular television serial, Rāmāyaṇ, the Bharatiya Janata Party leader Lal Krishna Advani’s rath yatra of 1990, and the kār sēva that culminated in the destruction of the Bābri Masjid at Ayōdhyā on 6 December 1992. Another programme of the Sangh parivar was to intervene and cause changes in the rites and ceremonies related to marriage and conjugal life. Women in Odisha were introduced to the maṅgalsūtra—hitherto alien to the region—as the arch symbol of marriage. The practice of applying vermillion (sindūra) at the spot above a woman’s forehead, where the hair is parted, was unknown to Kerala. The Sangh Parivar successfully introduced it in the state in the late 1990s. Other means adopted to develop Hinduism as a popular religion at the level of practice include the generalization of festivals like Dīpāvaḷi (Divāli), Vināyaka Caturthi, Navarātri, Karvā Chauth, Rakṣābandhan, Hōlī etc. Ceremonies like the Satyanārāyaṇa Pūja, Akṣaya Tṛtīya, and Guru Pūrṇimā were now performed widely, yōga, astrology, and Āyurvēda were redefined as legacies of the Hindu intellect, satsaṅgs and sessions of bhajans and kīrtans were performed day after day in temples and āśrams, the neoconservative opposition towards conversions to Christianity and Islam reinforced through propaganda, and new centres of pilgrimage invented in different parts of the country, including some, like Vaiṣṇōdēvi and Amarnāth, in the strife-ridden Jammu and Kashmir. Like a Christian visiting a Church or a Muslim offering namāz, the Hindus were expected to become absorbed into the newly-defined religious universe of their own with the consciousness that this was ordained upon them by their religion. These efforts were successful to a large extent.\n\nOnly now are we witnessing the real beginnings of Hinduism as faith, canon, practice, and identity. We are on the threshold of a new era. This is one of the great moments in the religious history of the Indian subcontinent in particular and humankind in general, when close to a sixth of humankind, with its large number of assorted traditions, beliefs, practices, rites, rituals, and legends, are being united, and directed towards a common destiny. It is a tragedy that this project, like the great enterprise of Ādayya and Ēkānta Rāmayya, is proceeding along ethically misbegotten lines. It is moving on the lines directed by the venomous Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the virulent Sangh Parivar that it has brought into existence. Inevitably enough, this great unification is governed by hate, suspicion, mistrust, intolerance, and finally, deep violence, both physical and psychological. There is certainly no hope in the foreseeable future, because although progressive forces of our times have the power to unite and give Hinduism a new shape, purpose, direction, and meaning, Hinduism will still continue to be a reified face of the unconscious, craving for retributive justice, an unconscious created by far-reaching historical forces that in the course of the late eighteenth, the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries dispossessed men and women in the subcontinent of their traditional inheritance of access to land and profession. Hinduism was born of an historically-created alienation. The many and varied results of this alienation not only remain with us today, but have also grown from strength to strength. A ‘progressive’, ‘humane’ and ‘peace-loving’ Hinduism cannot therefore be free from the deep psychological longing for retributive justice, even if peace and nonviolence is what it overtly preaches. A ray of hope will appear over the horizon, only when the alienation characterizing our lives and times, is historically liquidated. Only then will a new Hinduism come into existence.\n\n\n\n567 The choice was indeed inevitable, for hasn’t Sartre told us that “we are condemned…to make a choice”?\n\n568 Tottu is a form of domestic slavery involving sexual services as well. It is interesting that in Harihara’s Mahādēviyakkana Ragaḷe (3.76), the king, Kauśika, offers to be Akkamahādēvi’s tottu, if she agrees to marry him!\n\n569 Niṃbiyakkana Ragaḷe, 49-68.\n\n570 Cidānandāvadhūta Cāritra, 1.\n\n571 The pontiff was Mallikārjunappa Gauḍa of Bidanūru, a peer and associate of Kalaburagi Śaraṇabasava.\n\n572 Paranjape 2015: 16.\n\n573 Rajagopalachari nd: 16.\n\n574 Ibid. 19.\n\n575 “karmaṇyēvādhikārastē, mā phalēśu kadācana”, Bhagavad Gītā, 2.47.\n\n576 “yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, abhytthānaṃ adharmasya tadātmānaṃ sṛjāmyahaṃ; paritrāṇāya sadhūnāṃ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtāṃ dharmasaṃsthāpanārthāya saṃbhavāmi yugē yugē”, Ibid., 4.7-8.\n\n577 Kelkar 2011: 56."
