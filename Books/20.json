I see many treatments of the subject, from efforts to resolve real-life moral dilemmas in health care to highly sophisticated theoretical pieces. More importantly, as a neuroethicist I work on end-of-life issues for those with decreasing mental faculties. The relevance of human dignity does not need explanation in this context. Or does it?\nSince Macklin (2003) argued in the British Medical Journal that dignity is a useless concept in bioethics, interest in the topic has increased significantly, as have disagreements and disputes over the meaning of ‘dignity’.\nThe idea of conceptualising the topic around the Middle East and West divide is both unique and insightful. It is especially welcome in this time of tensions between the two regions, which infiltrate many areas of our lives.\nDoris Schroeder is one of the contemporary bioethicists whose work I most admire. Not only is it consistently well written and clearly argued, but it addresses topics that really matter in the lives of people. Most often she gives a voice to vulnerable populations that are too rarely represented in philosophical discussions. Doris is a philosopher who works in the world and is not confined to an ivory tower. She is one of fewer than half a dozen bioethicists writing today whose work I would seek out on any subject.\nUntil now, I have only been familiar with Bani-Sadr as a political figure in the Middle East. I know of his active part in the anti-Shah student movement in the early 1960s, and his later association with Ayatollah Khomeini that led to his installation as the first President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, ending with his dismissal when he broke with the cleric. Bani-Sadr’s standing as a learned scholar of the Koran and his outspoken criticism of violent regimes make him a uniquely qualified commentator, not only on the meaning of dignity in the Islamic tradition, but also on the consequences when power trumps dignity in the current political climate. I was surprised and riveted by his personal memories from the Iran-Iraq war.\nSchroeder and Bani-Sadr look at the topic of dignity from very different vantage points: one offers the perspective of Western philosophical analysis, the other the traditional perspective of the Koran. The way in which the two perspectives are finally combined in a call for a concept of dignity that could harmonise the main Western approaches to dignity with the Koranic interpretation is highly instructive: dignity as respect for and the protection of the self-worth of human beings.\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>Reference</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\nMacklin R (2003) Dignity is a useless concept.

This book, however, was written free of the deadlines and pressure of external funding, and we therefore had all the time in the world to develop our ideas. We are very happy that we finally settled on Springer as our publisher, because the ‘SpringerBriefs’ format suited our desire to produce a short book that was accessible to a wide audience.\nThe book goes back to a suggestion by Dr Mahmood Delkhasteh and Dr Miltos Ladikas that Doris might want to comment on an article by Mr Abol-Hassan Bani-Sadr. Mr Bani-Sadr enjoyed Doris’ comments, so Mahmood organised a personal meeting in Paris. That was in July 2004! As the book took shape, we communicated through Mahmood and his wife Dr Sarah Amsler, who also translated Mr Bani-Sadr’s contributions from Persian and contributed their own ideas. They are both successful academics with heavy workloads and a beautiful young daughter but remained loyal to this project to a degree that astounded and humbled us. Thanks are not enough, and we hope we can somehow reciprocate one day.\nThis is the fourth book that Prof. Schroeder has published with the guidance of senior Springer editor Fritz Schmuhl—and not the last, as he is quite exceptional. The same applies to our professional copy editor, Paul Wise, whose skills in editing, commenting and finding information are beyond comparison. As both are South Africans, we thank South Africa!\nWe also had very helpful comments from anonymous referees, whom we thank.\nWe are very grateful that Doris’ friend Prof. Tomi Kushner agreed to write a foreword. Discussions with her and her late husband Dr Mal Kushner were instrumental in forming her views on dignity. She also had several discussions about the book with Prof. Bob Brecher, who was one of those who encouraged her to take the risk of including a fictional dialogue as a conclusion. Hurray to Bob! Thanks also to the College of Health and Wellbeing at the University of Central Lancashire for sponsoring open access for this book.\nOthers whom Doris would like to thank for very useful discussions about the topic and the book are her husband Armin, Loane Skene, Thomas Pogge, Suzy Killmister, Avner de-Shalit, Roger Chennells, Paul Formosa, Sally Dalton-Brown, Cathy Lennon, Oliver Sensen, Michael Boylan, Peter Herissone-Kelly, Miltos Ladikas, Julie Cook Lucas, Peter Schaber, Apollonia Jungen (dignity role model), the University of Melbourne Philosophy Seminar, the Queen’s College Sugden Lecture audience and the International Bioethics Retreat. Most of the Western part of the book was written in Doris’ parents’ house—Albert and Mathilde Schroeder. Thanks for the breaks! Last but not least, Doris wants to thank Inge Mattiat and Uwe Nestler, who died—far too early—in 2012, and to whom this book is dedicated.\nMr Bani-Sadr would like to add that in our world, knowledge and science are sometimes used within power relations and sometimes to justify power. People who live life based on rights, who see hope and happiness as intrinsic in life and who succeed in replacing despair with hope, are rare. Dr Sarah Amsler and Dr Mahmood Delkhasteh are among this rare group of people. Mr Bani-Sadr thanks them whole-heartedly.\nAt a time when violence is taking over life and the dignity of humans and other creations is forgotten, it is a difficult task to invite people to recover their dignity. This book is about the concern that people forget their dignity. It tries to develop a meaning for dignity, so that people can remember what they have lost and through its rediscovery suggest a way of living in independence and freedom. Thank you to our readers for reading it.\nContents\n1 The Quest for Dignity 1\nReferences 6\n2 Dignity in the West 9\n2. 1 Introduction 9\n2. 2 Dignity’s Omnipresence 11\n2. 3 A Very Short History of Dignity 18\n2. 3. 1 Immanuel Kant’s Concept of Dignity 19\n2. 3. 2 Dignity in Legal Instruments 21\n2. 3. 3 Dignity in Bioethics 24\n2. 4 Disambiguating the Main Concepts of Dignity 27\n2. 4. 1 What Kind of Concept Is Dignity? 28\n2. 4. 2 Is Dignity a Virtue? 29\n2. 4. 3 Is Dignity an Individual Characteristic not Covered by Virtues? 32\n2. 4. 4 Is Dignity Intrinsic to Human Beings? 35\n2. 4. 5 Is Dignity God-Given? the Example of Christianity 46\n2. 5 Testing and Critiquing the Taxonomy of Dignity 49\n2. 5. 1 Dignity and Vagueness 52\n2. 5. 2 Could Dignity Be Replaced with Respect for Persons? 53\n2. 6 A Common Core of Dignity Building Blocks? 55\n2. 7 Concluding on the Dignity Riddles 57\nReferences 60\n3 Dignity in the Middle East 65\n3. 1 Islam: A Brief Overview of a World Religion 65\n3. 1. 1 The Prophet 66\n3. 1. 2 The Koran and the Hadîths 67\n3. 1. 3 Islam in Everyday Life 68\n3. 2 Introduction to Dignity in the Koran 69\n3. 3 Dignity and Power 71\n3. 4 Dignity and Freedom 74\n3. 5 How Dignity Becomes Realisable 78\nReferences 87\n4 Middle East and West: Can Common Ground Be Found? 89\n4. 1 Dignity—A Fictional Dialogue 90\nReferences 97\nIndex99\nAbout the Authors\nProfessor Doris Schroeder\nwhose background is in philosophy, politics and economics, is Director of the Centre for Professional Ethics at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) in the UK, Professor of Moral Philosophy in the School of Law at UCLan Cyprus, and Adjunct Professor at Charles Sturt University in Canberra, Australia.

Few other terms have been used in so many settings with so many contradictory meanings. Political events in the Middle East have given dignity new meanings. Some analysts have gone as far as calling the revolutions and civil wars that have dominated this region in the early 21st century the ‘dignity revolutions’. With this book we want to show that the concept of dignity can be meaningfully employed in politics, philosophy and everyday life, if one is clear about its different meanings, and about which of those meanings to use in what context.\nKeywords\nDignityDignity revolutions\nThere is no cultural system, Western or non-Western, however new or however old, that fully lives up to the idea of human dignity.\nWood (2008: 64)\nIt is difficult to write about dignity. Few other terms have been used in so many settings with so many contradictory meanings.\nOn the one hand, it is proclaimed that dignity1 can never be lost. ‘Dignity is inviolable ’ is the first sentence of the German constitution, to give an example. On the other hand, movements around the world declare that they are on a mission to acquire dignity for their constituencies. From Syrian refugee girls (UNICEF 2015) to government commissions investigating the neglect and abuse of elderly residents in care homes (Age UK n.d.), politicians and activists have used the term to support their quests.\nSwiss philosopher and novelist Peter Bieri (also known as Pascal Mercier ) captured some of the mysteries of the term ‘dignity’ in his novel Night Train to Lisbon. The novel sees middle-aged teacher Gregorius abandon his post and travel to Lisbon. There he meets a former resistance fighter, João Eça, who lives in a nursing home. One day, João Eça is reluctant to receive Gregorius for their regular chess meetings.\n> When João Eça stood in the door of his room … on Sunday, Gregorius saw in his face that something had happened. Eça hesitated before asking him in. It was a cold March day, yet the window was wide open.…\n> Eça moved the pawns. ‘I went in bed last night,’ he said in a rough voice. ‘And I didn’t notice it.’ He kept his eyes lowered to the board.…\n> Gregorius made tea and poured him half a cup. Eça saw the look that fell on his shaking hands.\n> ‘A dignidade,’ he said.\n> ‘Dignity,’ said Gregorius. ‘I have no idea what that really is. But I don’t think it’s something that gets lost just because the body fails.’\n> Eça botched the opening.\n> ‘When they led me to torture , I went in my pants and they laughed at it. It was a horrible humiliation ; but I didn’t feel I was losing my dignity. But what is it then?’\n> Did he believe he would lose his dignity if he had talked, asked Gregorius.\n> ‘I didn’t say a word, not a single word. I locked away all the possible words in me. Yes, that’s it: I locked them away and bolted the door irrevocably. So it was impossible for me to talk. … I stopped acknowledging the torturers as actors. They didn’t know it, but I degraded them. …’\n> And if they had loosened his tongue with a drug?\n> He had often asked himself that, said Eça, and he had dreamed of it. He had come to the conclusion that they could have destroyed him with that, but they could never take away his dignity in this way. To lose your dignity, you had to forfeit yourself.\n> ‘And then you get worked up about a dirtied bed?’ said Gregorius and shut the window. ‘It’s cold and it doesn’t smell, not at all.’ (Mercier 2009: 364−365)\n\nJoão Eça believes that he kept his dignity during torture and that the torturers could never have taken it from him. Yet he also believes that he lost his dignity when he ‘went in bed’. His chess partner Gregorius admits that he has no idea what dignity really means, but insists that it does not get lost when the body begins to fail. The interpretations of dignity that this short excerpt point to are already quite diverse. One is connected to willpower and effort (resisting torturers), the other is independent of either and refers only to the frailty of the ageing human body.\nThis book aims to illuminate the concept of dignity in the 21st century .2 What does it mean in the West? What does it mean in the Middle East? And could there be a common understanding? Or is there a common essence? Our attempt to answer these questions from a Western perspective will be done from a broad base, which includes fiction, politics and everyday life (e.g. sports), as well as the philosophical literature. There are three reasons for doing so:\n 1. 1.\n    Using examples from a wide range of contexts highlights vividly why the concept of dignity is so contentious in the 21st century.\n     \n 2. 2.\n    Dignity has become a popular topic in philosophy, and many excellent books that engage critically with a broad range of interpretations have been published recently.3 To add one that simply covers the same ground would probably not be very useful.\n     \n 3. 3.\n    The concept is so important in everyday life, as the many examples will show, that the discussion is intended not just for a specialised audience, but general readers too.\n     \n\nOne could ask: why draw a distinction between dignity in the Middle East and dignity in the West? Why not assume that we can agree on one universal concept, as envisaged by the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 (UN 1948)? To make this assumption would be to ignore the continuing heated debates about the essence of dignity. It would also not make the concept any clearer. If one had to pack everything that people could mean by ‘dignity’ into one concept, that concept might become meaningless. Any serious effort to describe dignity therefore has to disentangle different meanings first, and only then ask whether some of these meanings could be reconciled.\nWhile it may be desirable to strive for a universal understanding of dignity, in that it could facilitate intercultural dialogue, one of our reasons for writing this book is that dignity is too multifaceted a concept to be captured in one essence. Instead we strive to bring out the distinctions within Western concepts and then provide one Middle Eastern interpretation. This is necessary because dignity is one of the most controversial concepts of the 20th and 21st centuries. It has been described as powerful (Beyleveld and Brownsword 2001), yet useless and vague (Macklin 2003); arbitrary (Van Steendam et al. 2006), yet addictive (Wetz 2004); elusive (Ullrich 2003), yet widely used (Van Steendam et al. 2006); groundless (Rachels 1990), yet revolutionary (Wood 2008); of supreme importance, yet without reference point.4 And this is just a summary of Western academic debates (Fig. 1.1).\nFig. 1.1\nJudgements on the concept of dignity\nWithin this confusion, one looks to the Middle East and realises that political events have given dignity new meanings. Some analysts have gone as far as calling the revolutions and civil wars that have dominated this region in the early 21st century the ‘dignity revolutions ’ (Hassan 2011).\nWhile rising food prices, poverty , unemployment and corruption have contributed to these uprisings, commentators in the region and around the world have spoken of a dignity uprising: ‘ordinary Tunisians, Libyans, and Egyptians themselves describe the heart of this moment as a revolution for dignity’ (Marquand 2011). ‘But the uprisings were not only about jobs and bread; as Sudanese intellectual Abdelwahab El-Affendi wrote, … the revolutions were needed so that the people would deserve bread’ (Lynch 2011). The theme of restoring the dignity of the people pervaded the Arab uprisings . ‘Some will claim that the true, structural causes for these Arab revolts reside in the rising food prices or other objective economic factors. … But that is not what the street interviewees and commentators tell us: they speak of Anger, of Pride, of Humiliation and Dignity’ (De Cauter 2011). Or, as Fukuyama (2012) put it in an editorial entitled The Drive for Dignity:\n> The basic issue was one of dignity, or the lack thereof, the feeling of worth or self-esteem that all of us seek. But dignity is not felt unless it is recognized by other people; it is an inherently social and, indeed, political phenomenon. The Tunisian police were treating Bouazizi5 as a nonperson, someone not worthy of the basic courtesy of a reply or explanation when the government took away his modest means of livelihood.\n\nThe concept of dignity (Arabic karama) has often been used to comment on events in the Middle East. While dignity hardly ever featured in previous uprisings around the world, it is a ‘core theme… of the Arab uprisings , which united Arabs from Morocco to Oman’ (Hashemi 2013b). Commentators speak of a collective ‘assertion of self-dignity in the Arab world’ (Ilan Pappé in Barat 2011) after ‘decades of humiliation, despotism, and despair’ (Hashemi 2013a: 229) (see also Khouri 2011). It is therefore the right time to look at the concept of dignity in the Middle East.\nIlluminating the concept from both a Western and a Middle Eastern perspective will, we hope, also increase its clarity. While Western academic attacks on the concept might have a point (more in Sect. 2. 5. 1 on the ‘vagueness’ of dignity), the concept’s power in everyday life is considerable, as are the potential tediousness and philosophical sophistry of any alternatives. The following brief excerpt from an Australian novel could help illuminate this point:\n> Girlie had a new English teacher, an untidy, pimply young woman named Miss Boatwright, whom she couldn’t stand. She became as impatient as her mother, shooting up her hand to point out the teacher’s errors, creating disturbances, generally being delinquent. At recess, she made fun of the half-moons of sweat that stained the armpits of Miss Boatwright’s frocks…. Miss Boatwright’s efforts at salvaging her dignity only made Girlie more scornful. (Jennings 1996: 112)\n\nThe reader is flooded with images by just four sentences: images of pupils, teachers, classrooms and, at another level, images of desolation and loneliness. They will see that the schoolgirl lacks kindness, empathy, generosity and compassion. They may feel sorry for the teacher or think she should have chosen a different profession. But any attempt to find another, equally powerful formulation to replace the phrase ‘salvaging her dignity’ is likely to be fruitless. The power of the paragraph lies in this term and all its connotations. ‘Miss Boatwright’s efforts at salvaging her right to respect for persons and their autonomy only made Girlie more scornful’ just sounds dull and wearisome.\nWith this book we want to show that the concept of dignity can be meaningfully employed in politics, philosophy and everyday life, if one is clear about its different meanings, and about which of those meanings to use in what context.\nBox 1.1 West? Middle East?\nWe are two authors from different cultures. One born and raised in Cologne, Germany and one born and raised in Hamadan, Iran. This gives us certain perspectives, but that is not the reason why the sub-title of the book is “Middle East and West”.\nWe agreed this subtitle for three reasons.\nFirst, the “Western part” of the book uses so many different, mostly Western sources, from Aristotle to Kant , from Iris Murdoch to Paul Auster , from European newspapers to Internet sports pages, from the German constitution to American court cases, from psychology to Catholicism that a more precise specification was not possible.\nSecond, the “Middle Eastern part” of the book relies almost exclusively on the Koran , a book which conquered the world from its Middle Eastern origins.\nThird, the interpretation of dignity in light of the Koran presented in this book, is unusual, and could not be linked to either Shia or Sunni Islam interpretations.6 Bani-Sadr argues—using the Koran—that Western and Middle Eastern challenges today (e.g. the rise of ultra-right and populist movements in the West and the strong authoritarian tendencies within Islamic societies) have the same root: a distinction between “good power” and “bad power” His interpretation of dignity, on the other hand, assumes that power invariably results in domination and one cannot have “good domination” and “bad domination”, since domination is always a negation of human dignity and human rights.\nIn a conversation Bani-Sadr said: “It was around 40 years ago when I began my research for finding the roots of dignity in Western philosophy. That led me to Giovanni Pico della Mirandola , and his Oration of the Dignity of Man. He starts his treatise by stating: ‘Most esteemed Fathers, I have read in the ancient writings of the Arabians that Abdala the Saracen on being asked what, on this stage, so to say, of the world, seemed to him most evocative of wonder, replied that there was nothing to be seen more marvelous than man.’\nThe Arab man whom he is referring to is Ali, the fourth Caliph after the prophet Mohammed and the first Shia Imam in the 7th century. That led me to go back to the Koran and start my research about dignity and where, how and why the word is being used and what it actually means. There I found that all living beings have dignity and rights because they are created by God. To bring out the dignity in all beings requires that the discourse of power and domination is replaced by a discourse of freedom and independence.\nMy suggestion to thinkers within varies belief systems and discourses is to try to discover the discourse of freedom and independence, within their own belief system.”\nHence, the subtitle of this book is “Middle East and West” because the sources used cannot be traced to any more precise discourses (e.g. a solely Kantian approach or reliance on a Shia interpretation of the Koran ).\nOpen Access This chapter is licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http:// creativecommons. org/ licenses/ by/ 4. 0/ ), which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license and indicate if changes were made.\nThe images or other third party material in this chapter are included in the chapter’s Creative Commons license, unless indicated otherwise in a credit line to the material.

This chapter is an interpretation of dignity in Islam . To facilitate understanding of the dignity analysis, a short summary of Islam precedes the main discussion, which focuses on the relationships of dignity and power, and dignity and freedom .\nKeywords\nDignityMiddle eastFreedomPowerTawheed\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>3.1 Islam: A Brief Overview of a World Religion</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\nAll major religions make prescriptions about what is wrong and what is right, and all major religions refer to sacred texts (Weitz 2011: 13, 16, 18). Religions are teachings about life.\nFig. 3.1\nFreedoms deriving from dignity\nFig. 3.2\nFive principles for relationships\nIt is generally agreed that there are five world religions: Christianity with around 2.2 billion believers, Islam with 1.4 billion, Hinduism with 900 million, Buddhism1 with 500 million, and the smallest world religion, Judaism, with 15 million believers (Gaede 2012). Islam is the second largest world religion, with the highest numbers of believers in Indonesia (200 million), followed by Pakistan (174 million), India (160 million), Bangladesh (145 million), Egypt (78 million) and then Turkey and Iran (both 73 million) (Halm 2011: 7).\nIslam is also the youngest world religion. Yet the speed of its development, as well as its considerable geographical expansion, is an extraordinary phenomenon, even on a world scale (Lanczkowski 1989: 169). Originating with the prophet Mohammed in Mecca and Medina (more below), Islam took less than 200 years to spread to the South of France and well into today’s Russia.\nChristianity, Islam and Judaism are related religions; not only do they share their strong belief in monotheism, but they have early prophets (Halm 2011: 13),2 such as Abraham, in common and a geographically similar area of origin (Weitz 2011: 25f). According to some scholars, Islam developed in the context of Christianity and Judaism, but combined existing and new elements with such ‘genius’ (Reuter 2012: 89) that a powerful world religion was born. For instance, Judaism has strong rituals and rules to give believers strength, but no mission. Access to the kingdom of believers is usually only by birth. Christianity, on the other hand, is highly mission-based and access is straightforward. On the other hand, the everyday life of Christians is not rigidly regulated by rituals and prescriptions.\nIslam provides rituals and prescriptions and is open to everybody in a way that is not possible in Christianity and Judaism. (Regarding the simplicity of the Muslim confession of faith or credo, see below.)\n<size=h3><i>3.1.1 The Prophet</i></size>\nProphets have the task of guiding humanity through the messages they receive from God. In the case of Islam, the messages come from Allâh, which means ‘God’ in Arabic. The founder of Islam is the prophet Mohammed , who first received the words of God through the Archangel Gabriel. The name Mohammed is Arabic for ‘praised’ of ‘praiseworthy’. For Muslims, Mohammed is not just one in a long series of prophets: he is the last prophet, the seal of the prophets (châyam an-nabiyyîn) (Halm 2011: 12).\nDetails about the life of Mohammed have survived to the present day only through documents written after Mohammed’s death. The oldest biography of Mohammed was written by Muhammad ibn Ishâg, who was born in Medina in 706 (Halm 2011: 16). The date of Mohammed’s death is relatively uncontentious (8 June 632 CE), while the date of his birth is contested and ranges from 552 to 570 CE (Reuter 2012: 82; Armstrong 2001: 3). It is not disputed that he was born in Mecca as part of the Quraysh, the most powerful tribe in the city.\nMohammed never knew his father, who died around the time of his birth, and also lost his mother relatively early. She was buried when he was six, but even before then, he was taken away from her and raised first by a grandfather, then by an uncle (Reuter 2012: 83). As a young man, he accompanied his uncle on his camel trains (caravans) and thus met his first wife, Khadija, a rich, older business woman whom he married when he was 25. Through his marriage, he achieved financial independence (Halm 2011: 19). They were married for 24 years, until Khadija died, leaving him with four daughters, two sons having died in infancy. It was during his marriage to Khadija that he became a prophet who heard the words of God through the Archangel Gabriel.\n> In 610 Common Era, an Arab businessman had an experience that changed the history of the world. Every year …, Muhammad ibn Abdallah used to retire to a cave on the summit of Mount Hira, just outside Mecca … where he prayed, fasted and gave alms to the poor. … Mecca had become a thriving mercantile city, but in the aggressive stampede for wealth some of the old tribal values had been lost. Instead of looking after the weaker members of the tribe … the Quraysh were now intent on making money. … There was also spiritual restlessness in Mecca. (Armstrong 2001: 3)\n\nAccording to historical documents, Mohammed waited (Armstrong 2001: 3) for three years (Reuter 2012: 86) before he offered the words of God to the public. Only Khadija knew of his experience early on, and she became his first believer. When Mohammed went public with his experiences, the citizens of Mecca were not very impressed. Too many self-proclaimed prophets were preaching in the city. However, Mohammed was unlike any of them: the poetic melody of his prophesies and the magic of his words were apparently unsurpassed (Reuter 2012: 87). Still today, many non-Arabic Muslims learn to recite the Koran in Arabic, because of the poetic beauty of the language. It is also said that many converts to Islam were drawn to it when they first heard the text being read out loud (Esposito 2011: 10).\nWhen Mohammed’s wife Khadija and his uncle Abû Tâlib died in 619, his position in Mecca became precarious. He started negotiations with two tribes from Yathrib, a city 350 kilometres north-west of Mecca. Yathrib later became known as Medina, short for Madînat an-Nabî, which means ‘the city of the prophet’. In 622 the migration (hidjra) of Mohammed and his followers to Medina was completed. Later, the year of the migration was pronounced to be the starting point of the Islamic calendar.\nIn Medina, Mohammed increased his influence by mediating between the tribes, and over the next ten years he built the foundation of an Islamic state (Halm 2011: 18−21). At the same time, military battles took place between Medina and Mecca over several years. Yet in 630, before his death in 632, Mohammed was able to return to his home town of Mecca, where tribes including the Qurayish accepted the Koran as their sacred text and agreed to become Muslims (Halm 2011: 20).\n<size=h3><i>3.1.2 The Koran and the Hadîths</i></size>\nThe Koran (or qur’ān) is the sacred text of Islam , the message of God revealed through the prophet Mohammed . The word means ‘reading’ or ‘recitation’ in Arabic. The Koran consists of 114 individual texts called ‘surahs’ and around 77,000 words. Thus, it is much shorter than, for instance, the New Testament with 181,000 words (Sinai 2012: 11). Rather than being structured according to topics, the Koran is structured according to surah length, with the longer surahs at the beginning and the shorter ones at the end. Citation is usually by surah and verse (e.g. 97: 2). The longest surah contains 286 verses, of which some contain more than 20 words (Sinai 2012: 12). By the time the prophet Mohammed died in 632, he had received the entire text of the Koran , but it was only collected and put into written form after his death (Sinai 2012: 13).\n> For Muslims, Muhammad was neither the author nor editor of the Quran. Therefore, the Quran is the eternal, literal word of God, preserved in the original Arabic language. … Many Muslims experience deep aesthetic pleasure from listening to the rich, resonant, rhyming prose, with its repetitions and subtle inflections. (Esposito 2011: 10f)\n\nIslam does not rely solely on the revelations captured in the Koran . A second foundation on which the religion is built is the life of the prophet. For Muslims, the prophet was the ideal Muslim (Halm 2011: 43; Weitz 2011: 79). His life served and continues to serve as an example to all believers. What he said during his lifetime forms the hadîths , the prophet’s sayings. Most of the hadîths cover questions of right and wrong and also form the basis of Islamic law (sharî’a).3 In the everyday life of a Muslim, the hadîths are often seen as highly important (Halm 2011: 43).\n<size=h3><i>3.1.3 Islam in Everyday Life</i></size>\nThe term ‘Muslim’ comes from the Arabic and means ‘one who surrenders and submits to God’. By surrendering to God, one can achieve peace , according to the Koran (Weitz 2011: 75). Muslim life is based on five pillars or obligations. Here we will describe the obligations for Sunni Muslims, the largest branch of Islam.\nThe first is the confession of faith or credo (shahâda). In a two-part formula, every Muslim must express the fundamental belief that there is no god but God and that Mohammed is the prophet of God. Conversion to Islam is an easy, informal act. All that is required is to say the confession of faith in an honest spirit (Weitz 2011: 63).\nThe second obligation is the prayer ritual. Prayer consists of a range of movements that have to be performed five times a day (Weitz 2011: 63). Before praying, the believer has to perform a ritual cleansing. When praying, the believer has to face towards the Kaaba in Mecca, the most sacred site in Islam . This was introduced by Mohammed in the 18th month after his arrival in Medina. Before this change, prayers were made facing Jerusalem (Reuter 2012: 89).\nThe third obligation for any Muslim is the fasting at Ramadân, commemorating the month when Mohammed received the first revelation. Ramadân is always the ninth month of the Islamic moon calendar. Since the moon calendar is shorter than the 365-day sun calendar, the date of Ramadân always changes. The fasting requires that the believer take no food or fluid while the sun is up. There are exceptions for children and those who are ill, pregnant or very old, but otherwise the fasting rule applies to everybody. Of course fasting in winter is much less burdensome than fasting in summer. Ramadân lasts for one month.\nThe fourth obligation is alms for the poor. The community of muslims (umma) is a solidarity collective, and the affluent have to help the poor. The Koran does not stipulate an exact sum or percentage of income that needs to be donated, but a general rule of 10% has been established (Halm 2011: 71).\nThe fifth obligation is the pilgrimage to Mecca. Those who are privileged enough to be able to afford this journey (sometimes a village will save money so that one villager can go) are required to walk around the Kaaba seven times, as the main pilgrimage ritual (Halm 2011: 75).\nNot only has Islam been unusually fast and successful historically in spreading its message, but today, at the beginning of the 21st century, it is the fastest growing of all world religions (with a 1.84% growth rate between 2000 and 2005) (Admin 2007).\nWhat follows is an introduction to an understanding of human dignity in the Koran. It includes brief parallels with the Western understanding of dignity.\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>3.2 Introduction to Dignity in the Koran</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\nAccording to the Koran ,4 everything created is noble and dignified (Koran 17:70; 42:7; 31:10). The dignity of each and every living phenomenon emanates from and is connected to intelligent life itself (Koran 21:26−27; 49:13). This pronouncement from the Koran is reminiscent of both the Catholic belief that dignity is God-given and the Kantian belief that dignity is irrevocably linked to rationality .\nBecause of their dignity, all persons are free and, as long as they are not neglectful of God, they are also noble. One achieves this nobility in three steps:\n * First by willingly enduring trial (ebtelaa) (Koran 89:15).\n * Second by refusing to submit to the law of force (Koran 25:25).\n * Third by recognising the nobility of all phenomena and the dignity of all creation, including one’s own self-worth (Koran 17:23; 89:17−18, emphasis added).\n\nHumans become and remain noble through virtuous acts (Koran 49:13), and virtue is realised both in the expansion of freedom through development (Koran 72:14) and by excelling in learning, justice, service for others and friendship (Bani-Sadr 1992: 1371). This reference to the Koran and its interpretation are strongly reminiscent of the Western understanding of dignity as a virtue .\nFurthermore, in Islam , human dignity increases as we honour each individual and encourage them to increase their own dignity. For this reason, it is stated in the Koran that there is no compulsion in religion. Religion is a method of ‘deviolentisation’, a way of removing the role of force from society and replacing humiliation with dignity. In other words, nobility is an attribute of God and, like any other of God’s attributes, it exists in human beings. The Catholic equivalent formulation is that human beings are created in the image of God.\nGod’s gift to humans—indeed to all creatures—is that they are created free and with dignity. We can see this in the story of human creation as told in the Koran. Here, God informs the angels that a successor (a vicegerent) will be created on earth. For a Catholic this may sound like a reference to a prophet such as Jesus, but the story in the Koran talks about human beings as successors and vicegerents, not a single prophet. The story says that the angels asked God ‘will you place therein one who will make mischief and shed blood?’. God replied ‘I know what you know not’ (Koran 2:30). From the Koranic perspective, history is a successive cycle of alienation and awakening; one group of people strays from its own human nature (fetrah), leading to its destruction and that of its environment; another takes up the torch and becomes conscious of its humanity and tries to reverse the destruction.\nHistorical process, therefore, is a process of development, and human dignity is forged as some awakened human beings assume roles of leadership in it. However, it often happens that people are alienated in power relations and become instruments of destructive power. Nevertheless, as the process of history is a movement from decay to development, whenever one group of people moves towards demise, another will rise to revolution and open the horizon for human development (Koran 6:129−134, 164−165; 7:69, 129; 10:13, 14, 73; 11:50−57; 24:55; 16:59−62). Even when an entire nation begins to decay, there are some individuals who live in freedom, enhance their dignity (their nobility and their virtue ), and create a new revolution that paves the way for human freedom and development. By standing for the right and the good, they become God’s vicegerents on earth (Koran 10:70−82).\nWhat differentiates the path of life from the path of death and destruction? We must remember that only the free human is noble; therefore human dignity is contingent upon the recognition of one’s own nobility (self-worth ) and others’ nobility. Neglect of others’ dignity is a result of the neglect of one’s own. This is similar to Kant’s views on dignity, as he emphasises that one has obligations to oneself to uphold one’s dignity as well as an obligation to others to respect theirs. The neglect of one’s own and others’ dignity grows out of submission to force. When force becomes universal, corruption also becomes universal (Koran 24:18; 89:12). In other words, violence —including violence in the form of extreme poverty —can destroy life and environment.\nWhen a people submits to force, its members also start to perceive themselves as objects. Again, one can observe a similarity to Kant’s Formula of Humanity , which forbids seeing and treating other people solely as means to one’s own ends. Arrogance based on power breeds opportunities for humiliation , just as superiority necessitates inferiority, for power does not exist without destruction. This not only means that when one strives for superiority others must be humiliated; worse, in humiliating others one loses one’s own dignity by becoming an instrument of, and indeed synonymous with, power and force itself. A person who seeks superiority in this way has already become inferior. Hence, liberation from universal humiliation , violence and poverty can only be accomplished by recognising one’s fetrah, or human nature, and believing that ‘never will Allah change the condition of a people until they change it themselves’ (Koran 13:11). If we achieve this, then we can revolutionise ourselves and realise the dignity which is unique to us—unique because humans have accepted God’s ‘trust’ (Koran 33:72).\nThis trust to which the Koran refers is nothing but the responsibility of leadership towards development and freedom (Bani-Sadr 1992). By assuming this responsibility, we not only develop ourselves, but also undertake the development of our environment, both of which can only be realised in freedom . This stands in opposition to the growth of power, which only increases violence, destruction, poverty and inequality. The process of development should be seen as a single process; hence, there is no development if one section of the human community becomes rich while another becomes poor, or if some increase their wealth at the expense of the environment. This is rather a process of enslavement to the laws of power. Therefore what distinguishes living in freedom from living towards death and destruction is the absence of compulsion. If human beings neglect their responsibility as God’s worldly vicegerents, they will not only lead the world to destruction; at this point, they become depleted of dignity.\nAs mentioned above, people are born with fetrah, and as a result they are endowed with divine attributes. One such attribute is tawheed , or holistic unity. This central attribute, the core of human nature, also functions as a guiding principle for living.5 The loss or forgetting of this attribute leads to the emergence of belief systems which are based on dichotomies, ways of seeing the world which polarise rather than unite. This is the meaning of kofr, or blasphemy—it is the ultimate loss of dignity (Koran 35:39). God’s warning is thus clear: blasphemy is nothing but forgetting that we are God’s vicegerents on earth, the neglect of our own freedom and loss of our own nobility, becoming wretched, and causing harm to ourselves and others (Koran 10:26−27).\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>3.3 Dignity and Power</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\nAs noted earlier, historical processes are characterised by the recurring demise of groups which succumb to blasphemy and the subsequent rise of others which strive to honour human dignity. However, according to the Koran , it is tawheed that will ultimately be the destiny of humankind. Right will replace falsity and people will genuinely become God’s vicegerents on earth (Koran 24:18, 55).6 This principle refers not only to the past, but to the future as well. How do we know this? How do we know that life will continue so that believers can fulfil this role?\nInitially, according to the Koran , humans were created from a mud which contained all the ingredients of life, into which God blew spirit (Koran 55:14; 32:7–10). Human fetrah became godlike, and the fetrah was tawheed (Koran 30:30),7 in the best proportions and most beautiful (Koran 95:4; 82:7; 64:3), and God congratulated himself on this creation (Koran 23:12–14). Life could not emerge without tawheed; Imam Ali once said that human beings are microcosms of the entire universe. God created humans and other living beings with dignity and called upon humans to uphold this dignity. Humans volunteered to assume this responsibility, while other living beings did not. However, if in time God’s earth is not to be depleted of vicegerents, there must be people to carry out the responsibility of acting in this capacity.\n> We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof; but Man undertook it – he was indeed unjust and foolish. (Koran 33:72)\n\nActing in the capacity of vicegerents is only possible if humans accept the responsibility of trust, with their entire being (Koran 17:36), a kind of leadership that reflects and guarantees the continuation of this responsibility. In order to assume it, human beings need a spiritual dimension: they have to develop their abilities, and actively and continuously strive for improvement. Only in this context can we see the importance of leading ourselves and others. We have been given divine attributes to be able to assume this responsibility. The Koran explains that God taught humans—both non-believers and believers—the names of these attributes (Koran 2:31), as well as the ability to speak and to write (Koran 96:4−5; 55:3; 2:282). God gave human beings the talent of seeking knowledge, intelligence and wisdom, and the ability to become conscious of themselves and distinguish between good and evil.\n‘We have shown him the sign of ourselves so he begins to reflect’ (Koran 76:2; 75:14; 57:17). God has also given human beings talents such as innovation, creativity and industry. But some people became passive and some became active; in other words, some used their talents for development and others, through resorting to lies, deception and force, destroyed them (Koran 21:80; 16:76; 7:191; 29:17). God also gave humans a nature which seeks justice and showed them the way towards it (Koran 4:135; 42:15). God gave humans the talent of leadership , creating us as free and goal-oriented (Bani-Sadr 1992), so that people could distinguish between development and mutiny (Koran 2:256). This guidance was given to both believers and non-believers, and God warns that all those who stray from the path of development will inevitably lead lives of greed, excess and ultimately destruction and death (Koran 76:3; 96:6).\nDespite these gifts, human beings are imperfect. They can become alienated from their fetrah and weak and restless (Koran 4:28; 70:19). As noted earlier, humans generally fall into two groups: one that develops its talents, and another that destroys them by resorting to force and deception (Koran 21:80; 16:76; 7:191; 29:17). If one stays steadfast in fetrah, weaknesses will become strengths and dignity will be increased. However, if perspectives shift away from tawheed , life forces will become transformed into forces of death, leading to tyranny, death and destruction.\nThe Koranic explanation of human alienation reminds us of a fact we often ignore, namely that human rights are intrinsic to human beings. Each person, as a vicegerent of God, is born free, born a leader. Before human beings assume any belief (religious or otherwise), they have rights and a responsibility to defend these rights, as well as those of any other person irrespective of belief, race, nationality, ethnicity and so on. In other words, rights are not given to people through agreements among humans; we are born with them. This is in line with the interpretation of dignity as an intrinsic property for rational beings, leading to rights, as in Kant ; and for all human beings, as God’s gift, as in Catholicism. In Islam , one cannot gain or lose rights by believing or disbelieving in any specific belief system, including Islam. There is no compulsion in religion (Koran 2:256). A person has, among other rights, the right to turn towards religion.\nHowever, a Koranic lesson that is highly important is this. So long as people want to remain free and are conscious of their freedom , it is impossible for a power to emerge that would lead to the loss of freedom and rights. Such a power emerges when people become alienated and forget freedom, rights and dignity. No one can revoke one’s dignity but oneself, and only when one defends rights does one become God’s vicegerent on earth. Like many constitutions around the world, the Koran claims that dignity is inviolable and already embedded in human nature, as noted by Abraham (Koran 16:120−123), who spoke on behalf of humanity. In defending dignity and rights, humans are never alone; God is always with us, and we will emerge victorious in the end.\nBut why are freedom and rights intrinsic in human beings? Neither can be defined by any principle other than tawheed . In this context, some would argue that one person’s freedom begins where another’s ends. However, if this defines freedom , can we argue that every individual’s knowledge stops where another’s starts, or that one person’s creativity ends where another’s begins? Or can we argue that our talents for justice, friendship and love end where those of others start? If we argue this way, we can see that power is embedded in this definition of freedom , as without it we cannot say that one freedom ends where another begins. Force is the absence of freedom. Hence, if we reduce freedom to exercise force, then each individual becomes a prisoner of the freedom of others, and relations become power relations. It is obvious in this case that the stronger will violate the freedom of the weak. Within power relations, freedom, human rights, human life and nature become casualties.\nHowever, if we see freedom and rights based on the principles of tawheed , we can sense that freedom; it is a freedom that the intellect feels at the moment of creativity, at the moment we become one with intelligent life. This is why any ideas which are devoid of force become ‘free’. Thus, not only can freedom not be limited; it furthermore removes limits and boundaries; it is not the limit of another’s freedom, but its extension.\nWhat are the freedoms that God’s generosity has given us?\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>3.4 Dignity and Freedom</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\nWith dignity, God has also given human beings freedoms (Fig. 3.1).\n 1. 1.\n    The freedom to choose one’s guiding principles. No one can be forced to accept the guiding principles of power. This freedom can be linked to the Kantian foundation of dignity, namely the human intellect’s power to be self-legislative.\n     \n 2. 2.\n    The freedom to choose goals.\n     \n 3. 3.\n    The freedom to choose to establish free relations. If one does not want to enter into power relations with others and nature, no one from outside can force a human being to do so. Even while immersed in fire, Abraham did not lose the freedom of his intellect, and instead used it to turn the fire cold. As long as one does not enter into the closed circuit of power, one can preserve freedom of the intellect, establish free relations with those who function within power relations, remain free, help others become conscious of their freedom, and indeed become prophets of freedom.\n     \n 4. 4.\n    The freedom to choose information, ideas and discourses (whether of power or freedom).\n     \n 5. 5.\n    The freedom to attain knowledge. Learning is a human talent, and a human right.\n     \n 6. 6.\n    The freedom to innovate, invent and create. No one can be deprived of this freedom, as it, like life itself, is limitless, and the human intellect feels this freedom at the moment of creativity.\n     \n 7. 7.\n    The freedom of leadership , which coordinates the activities of all other human talents according to certain guiding principles. No one can externally deprive a person of the talent of leadership and freedom of action so long as this is not desired. If God wanted to guide everyone he would do so (Koran 32:13; 28:56; 27:81, 92; 30:53; 2:276), but human beings have the freedom and ability to guide themselves.\n     \n\nOther human talents, such as love, art and economy (which coordinates other talents in the process of development) are also internal freedoms . There is a misconception that power can give or take freedom, but this could not be further from the truth. Only when people are addicted to force can they become neglectful of freedoms. Freedom is intrinsic to life and cannot be given or taken. To explain this, we know that ‘negative freedom’ is understood as an open domain for thought, expression and action. Since power can close this circuit, it has been believed that power can grant and remove freedom. However, it was through God’s generosity that this domain became infinite and the discourse of freedom became the method of development in freedom. Hence, when confronted with force, God has to remember his generosity and use a method for eliminating force. God has to protect internal freedom, that limitless freedom which is the lack of compulsion, and prevent us from being alienated in the closed domain of force.\nFor instance, the closed circuit of compulsion which has created racial, ethnic and national borders was born out of neglect of the fact that all humans share a common nature. Addiction to power has made us forget this, and if humans do not heed their nature, their ever-increasing production and consumption of violence will endanger human and natural life alike. It is only through the process of accepting this common human nature that an individual will accept that s/he is equal with others, and that all these apparent differences, including differences of religion, are only matters of identification.\nHumans all share the same precious nature. Take, for example, the Koranic explanation for gender equality. After Adam was banished from Heaven, he repented. As a result, neither men nor women are born sinners. Until the advent of Islam , however, women were perceived as subhuman and the source of men’s deception in the Garden of Eden. The Koran challenged this view and argued that men and women were equal. It argued that men and women shared the same soul (Koran 4:1; 36:36); that they were from one another, and that the one was the other. At the same time, the Koran noted that they had different virtues. For instance, until then, women had been perceived in philosophical and religious belief as the source of corruption and death. However, the Koran recognises the following virtues in women:\n 1. 1.\n    A woman is a kosar 8 and farm of life (Koran 108; 2:223); a farm which never becomes arid as long as she lives in harmony with her nature. On this farm, seeds are planted with love, and fruit ripens and is cultivated in love.\n     \n 2. 2.\n    A woman is a teacher of love. She turns marriage to the centre of love and prevents men from going astray in animosity, to return to the farm of love (Koran 30:21; 7:189).\n     \n 3. 3.\n    God created women as artists: they have the ability to transcend domains which are limited by different dominant beliefs at different times. According to the Koran , throughout time, women played a key role in the transition from old eras to new. That, it says, is the artistry of women. Kaaba (in Mecca) is the holiest place for Muslims; all pray towards it. A slave woman named Hajar is buried in its centre. She gave a child to Abraham in his old age (Koran 37:109) and, with the love of motherhood, brought water from the burning sands of the desert to a spring which still flows. This fountain is a sign of the continuity of life. In another example, Moses’ mother gave her son to the water and the Pharaoh’s wife rescued him. Moses was raised in the palace of the Pharaoh, who had ordered his soldiers to kill all male infant Jews (Koran 28:7−8). Mary gave birth to Jesus without a husband (Koran 3:45−48; 23:50), and Mohammad sought solace from the anxiety and burden of the responsibility of prophecy in the arms of Khadija, his first wife. It was thus a statement of fact when he said that ‘Khadija was half the prophecy’.\n     \n 4. 4.\n    Women have the excellence of motherhood. The Koran reminds children to increase their respect for their mothers (Koran 31:14) and the Prophet stated that paradise is under the feet of mothers.\n     \n 5. 5.\n    Women are an indicator and reminder of men’s dignity. The inferiority of women in societies is a sign of social decadence. Honouring women is the sign of a healthy society and of men’s dignity. However, it is a woman’s job to protect her dignity by elevating her dignity and calling to men to recognise her and all creation (Koran 2:237).\n     \n\nMen also have virtues , which combine themselves with women’s; justice is the criterion which regulates this combination. Here are men’s virtues, as combined with women’s virtues:\n 1. 1.\n    The excellence of fatherhood, when combined with the excellence of motherhood, will develop the talent of leadership and widen the space for development even further.\n     \n 2. 2.\n    The virtue of consistency and ability to trust from time to time may be undermined in men. Hence, when the ability of a woman to reproduce this confidence in a man becomes intertwined with a man’s excellence, it will lead to a lasting love relationship.\n     \n 3. 3.\n    A woman is the measure of generosity, and a man by honouring this generosity in women will remain in touch with his own dignity. In other words, by their very existence women remind men of their dignity. It is in this context we can see that ‘virtue ’ means the recognition of each other’s dignity. Hence, any attempt to increase women’s dignity also increases men’s dignity. Consequently, the composition of these excellences in men and women, by honouring other created beings, will increase the element of dignity throughout creation.\n     \n 4. 4.\n    Women are teachers of love, and one of men’s virtues is to defend women’s freedom and independence against violation. However, the prime defenders of this are women themselves. The combination of these two talents will make the family the centre of mutual trust and love, and will remove force from human relations (Koran 2:237): ‘And do not forget Liberality between yourselves. For God sees well All that ye do.’\n     \n\nHence, drawing a strict boundary between women’s and men’s excellences would not only make their combination impossible; it would also indicate a neglect of both male and female excellences. It follows that when marriage is not based on the combination of a woman’s and man’s talents, then power relations will dictate the terms of the relationship. Not only this, but love and friendship will then be marginalised in such a relationship; in fact, it will turn marriage into a power-producing arrangement which will destroy the relationship.\nHere it seems necessary to mention that according to the Koran , Satan was the first being who, through belief in power, saw himself as superior to humans by referring to the differences between human beings and himself (Koran 7:12): ‘(God) said, “What prevented Thee from bowing down When I commanded thee?” He said: “I am better than He: Thou didst create Me from fire, and him from clay.”’\nGod therefore asked people not to follow Satan and his belief in power, and not to establish boundaries based on gender, race, ethnicity or nation, and reminded them that God had created them in different colours and no colour had superiority over the others: ‘And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, the variations in your languages and your colours: verily in that are Signs for those who know’ (Koran 30:22). After all, the sole reason for placing people in tribes and nations was so that they could recognise one another: ‘O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other. Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things)’ (Koran 49:13).\nTherefore, to live in freedom means to be equal in regard to rights, duties and participation in the responsibility of leadership , irrespective of race or financial status. It is important to notice that prior to the Koran , in various philosophical and religious beliefs, justice was defined on the basis of inequalities. The Koran , however, defines justice as a line which separates ‘beings’, or the freely created, from ‘non-beings’, which are products of force. To explain this, we need to know that ‘force’ by its nature is not only incapable of constructing, but in fact tends to destruct whatever it interacts with. Therefore any inequality in the domain of politics, economy, culture and society is a product of force and leads to the destruction of people, other creatures and nature. However, different but compatible characteristics, such as excellences in men and women, indicate equality between the pairs, as they share the same origin (Bani-Sadr 1992). The only time acquired inequalities may be seen in the context of justice is when they are a result of competition between people in terms of leadership , knowledge, justice, service, or training of the body, mind and spirit (Bani-Sadr 1992). Moreover, those who win such a race should not only refrain from using their privileged position to dominate others and create inequalities, but also realise that their dignity depends on having regard for others’ dignity by helping them towards self-improvement. The combination of succeeding in such competition and living in dignity will make the ‘winners’ forecasters (Koran 35:19−24); role models and imams (leaders) of development for those who have fallen behind. Such dynamism creates a process, a movement, from inequality to equality in an open horizon of spirituality (Bani-Sadr 1992).\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>3.5 How Dignity Becomes Realisable</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\nTo ensure a better understanding of what dignity means in Islam , we now discuss the type of honour (takrim) which increases dignity.\nGod has created enough of everything in nature (Koran 54:49); it is humans who create scarcity. The question is, how? The answer: they forget their dignity and that of all creation. As a result, they transform non-material needs into material ones, authenticate force and turn this force into the basis for their relationships with themselves, others and nature. This is accomplished in the following way.\nNatural needs cannot be realised by the consumption of unnatural products. The human body has certain needs, but the products which one uses to satisfy those needs should not create a power relation within the body. Hence, the production and consumption of products which have destructive effects on the body are a result of the neglect of dignity (Koran 5:90−91; 2:173; 6:145). Furthermore, the Koran emphasises and encourages thinking people to notice that when the principle of dichotomy becomes the guiding principle of thought and action, then the open circuit of material↔spiritual will be transformed into a closed circuit of material↔material. In this closed circuit, even spiritual needs have to be realised through material ones, and as non-material needs become material, their realisation only becomes possible through mass production and consumption. As a result, as these needs increase, natural resources decrease.\nFor example, the love between man and woman is spiritual, as the right to love is a spiritual love. However, if love becomes alienated in ‘sheer lust’, then the element of ‘time’, which is infinite in love, becomes finite in lust. As the needs of love are realisable through non-material and spiritual means, the needs for sheer lust are only realisable through material production. Hence, such needs have to be constantly renewed. Therefore, the closed circuit of material↔material production and consumption is accompanied by waste and dissipation (Koran 17:53; 6:121; 4:76). Since it is impossible for everyone to participate in the competition for mass consumption, poverty is constantly increasing, both in human communities and in the natural environment. Hence, we are observing the erosion of human communities, the great majority of them by poverty and a small minority by mass consumption.\nCertain methods for harmonising material and spiritual needs were recommended at a time when the communities on the Arabian Peninsula were living in poverty. The teachings noted that any consumption which negatively affects the natural balance of the body and deranges the mind is wastefully extravagant and fatal. It taught people that if they do not try to develop and actualise their talents, the energy used for these talents cannot stay unoccupied and hence will be used for domination and transgression (Koran 96:6). However, the question is: how do we know that we are on the path to development and not domination (and fozoon talabi or greed)? There are 14 ways to measure this.\n 1. 1.\n    Human development should be accompanied by the prosperity of nature. Hence, any development which is accompanied by environmental destruction should not be seen as development but an act of dominance and greed, which eventually will lead both humans and the environment to the valley of death. According to the Koran , the elimination of ethnic groups and cities resulted from their deviation from the path of development.9\n     \n\nThere are two approaches to the relationship between human beings and their environment. One perceives nature as an active entity and humans as passive subordinates to nature, and the other sees humans as a dominant entity which has to conquer nature and ferociously exploit its resources for the wholesale consumption of its resources. How is it possible, one can ask, that the Koran provides us with the solution to encroaching environmental disaster, when it was written 1,400 years ago in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula? How is it possible that such a warning should have come from anyone but God?\n 1. 2.\n    If a right creates a zero-sum relation in which one will reap benefit at the expense of someone else’s loss, then this cannot be seen as a right. Even if a ‘right’ is seen as an entity which one has and the other does not, this also is not ‘right’ but falsity. If we can see that human rights are not exercised in their totality in any country, then will it be wrong to assume that the reason for this is that those who are aware of these rights feel themselves to be entitled to them but do not see as their duty the defence of these rights in regard to others? If so, then one can only explain this discrepancy by arguing that the guiding principles of these people’s thoughts and actions are based on power relations. On this ground, as pointed out already, there is a zero-sum relationship between self rights and other rights. Those whose functioning is based on this principle regard themselves as having a right over animals and nature. However, do such people recognise not only their duty to ensure that nature and animals do not suffer as the result of the exercise of right, but also that it should involve the furthering of natural prosperity? This is not generally the case, precisely because the utilisation of resources can become part of the domain of power relations, and this is inevitably accompanied by destruction.\n     \n\nWhy does this happen? In short, because in these relationships humans become negligent of their identity, and consequently do not recognise the dignity surrounding them. However, if they apply the principle of tawheed , humans do not perceive themselves to be in opposing relations with other living beings and nature. This view makes it possible to exercise rights, and hence the defence of right becomes one’s method for living. Also, one perceives ‘duty’ solely as the exercise of ‘right’, and hence any duty which stands outside rights is a commandment of force and will not be obeyed. Finally, one should consider any expediency which stands outside rights as mere corruption, since to exercise such an expediency will violate right in favour of power.\n 1. 3.\n    Pairs enjoy dignity (Koran 24:26; 42:7). To explain this, we can say that humans are not born in order to spend their time struggling and fighting with each other. Hence, those who use religion as an excuse to dominate others are walking in the path of Satan (Koran 4:76). When the principle of dichotomy replaces that of tawheed, people begin to believe that struggle is the basis of life. As a result, a great part of their talents and natural resources is wasted in the production and consumption of violence (e.g. weapons and drugs). The expenditure for wars, all types of wars, destroys natural resources, leads to the expansion of poverty and brings us to the brink of environmental collapse. In order to overcome this, people need to establish relationships based on five principles: the right to participation, the right to differ, the right to friendship, the right of the weak to become able and equal to able people, and, as a result, the right to peace (Fig. 3.2).\n     \n 2. 4.\n    When a transparent intellect has transparent goals and methods, it is a ‘free intellect’. However, when power becomes the goal, then the intellect will become immersed in ambiguity. As a result of immersion in this increasing darkness, humans become neglectful of their rights and dignity, and those of other created beings. That is why the Koran states that evil will plunge people into darkness and that to turn to God is to come out of this darkness towards the light (Koran 2:257). The Koran is generous in part because it is transparent and free from ambiguity. Furthermore, it is a method for escaping the ambiguity of worshipping power and for entering the lightness of gaining dignity. It is impossible to be transparent when one neglects dignity, freedom and other rights, and when thought, speech and action are based on force. Hence, the only way to realise freedom and human dignity is for thought, speech and action to be entirely clear and transparent.\n     \n\nSince this principle is based on de-violentisation and opening the closed circuit of force into an open circuit characterised by the absence of force and freedom, the Koran says that peace is a blessing. The way to achieve peace is to come out of darkness and into light. Peace increases dignity (Koran 11:52, 53; 4:128; 5:165; 33:44; 25:25, 26). Virtue is achieved by removing all forms of compulsion. Dignity will be realised when virtue is achieved.\n 1. 5.\n    According to the Koran, Satan was originally an angel who began to discriminate and, as a result, became neglectful of his/her destiny. Any discrimination creates demarcation; each demarcation despises and becomes despised, and hence to demarcate is to lose dignity. To be free from discrimination is to gain dignity. To see oneself as superior or inferior to others comes from losing dignity; however, if you see yourself as superior your dignity suffers less than that of someone who sees him/herself as inferior. This is why forgetting one’s abilities is to neglect one’s dignity and to become addicted to feeling inferior, which is a greater tyranny (Koran 2:61; 23:27; 30:29, 54; 4:148, 149; 35:10).\n     \n 2. 6.\n    It has already been mentioned that to honour all created beings absolutely is to add to one’s own dignity. The moment of creativity is the moment at which we become one with life. This is when a person will feel the full meaning of authentic freedom. Hence, if people become one with life in their activities and talents and feel that freedom , they live in God, as God’s vicegerents, and help others to develop as well as themselves. It is dignity to honour both creator and created (Koran 2:186, 256; 11:97; 72:14).\n     \n 3. 7.\n    When this occurs, all social institutions, including religious and educational institutions, will have been founded on human dignity and rights. At present, most social institutions and systems are instead based on honouring the structures of power. That is why in our societies there is a constant conflict between dignity, human rights and power, and in this struggle power always wins over human dignity.\n     \n\nIt is in this context that aggressive wars and torture , which humiliate humans to an unimaginable level and even lead to their death, are regarded as justified. We have seen this in the execution of hundreds of prisoners at the Qala-i Jangi fortress in Afghanistan, and also in the systematic torture of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib and so on. All are ‘justified’ with arguments that goals justify means. We are told that the unimaginable torture and humiliation of prisoners—so extreme that even some of the torturers cannot bring themselves to take part in it—are carried out in order to prevent major terrorist acts. But terrorism continues and spreads despite this torture; it will be the shame of human beings in years to come. Now people become spectators to torture and terrorism, despite the fact that they see that these practices are producing social harm and that these methods of torture not only violate human dignity and rights but also contribute to the rise in terrorism. Yet still both the terrorism and the torture continue.\nTorture leads to the spread of terrorism. Such methods increase the very thing they are meant to eliminate because their use proves to the people involved that from the state’s point of view, power has dignity, not humans. Social groups and even whole societies also start to believe that power and its manifestations (e.g. money) have primary dignity. Hence, these manifestations have become social gods because humans have been devalued and lost their dignity. When humans lose their dignity, then violence inevitably becomes global.\nThe methods used by the West, especially America’s preventive war or the ‘fight against terrorism’, have led to the spread of terrorism and other types of violence. To break this vicious circle, the only solution is for human dignity to replace power. We need to renew social structures so that they are based on the dignity of rights. We need open social systems that are able to transform; social systems in which human dignity and rights become realities and accumulate in the process of development.\n 1. 8.\n    To exercise and defend rights increases human dignity. To reconsider truth and to speak it, even if we suffer for it (Koran 4:135), also increases dignity. A human being has the right to know and the right and duty to state the truth. If we do not seek truth and reality, we will become prisoners of a fantasy world and allow ourselves to be manipulated by power and lose our own dignity. That is why to tell the truth before a tyrant—to speak truth to power—is a great jihad (jihad afzal), and to tell the truth to oneself, and to remind oneself of rights and duties to exercise these rights is the greatest jihad (jihad akbar). Both forms of jihad are attempts to become knowledgeable about one’s dignity, to increase it and recognise it in all human beings.\n     \n 2. 9.\n    When we become cognisant of our dignity, we have an open future (Koran 75:5). More than 40 years ago, Willy Brandt, then Chancellor of Germany, promised that humans would achieve a time of plenty. This was when two competing ideologies—Marxism and liberalism—were each claiming to offer the best prescription for development. However, when one cannot make every moment of the future present, such claims are fantasies created by discourses of power in order to deceive. In other words, if within liberal or Marxist systems it was actually possible to move towards the time of plenty, this possibility should have been experienced more and more every day. However, because both systems function within the closed circuit of material↔material, both lead to increases in need, so that demand always exceeds supply. We can estimate the use of natural resources and the extent of the damage it is causing to the environment. Hence, I came to the conclusion that both economic systems (capitalism and socialism) make it possible to use up natural resources in advance and by doing so predetermine the future. In other words, by closing off the future, human beings alive today are humiliating themselves. Now we can see that teenagers are fearful of the future, fearful of not finding jobs, fearful that they will have worse lives than their parents. How can politicians, who have become incapable of solving contemporary social problems, talk about solving the future? While we know that the future must be open to exercise dignity, in order to open it we have to replace a closed circuit of material↔material with material↔spirit.\n     \n 3. 10.\n    There are different points of view about what constitutes dynamic forces, but there is consensus that humans and their guiding principles are the main elements. However, when guiding principles are based on a discourse of power , this leads to the destruction of dynamic forces and the environment. When we look at the contemporary world, we see a sickening form of expertise, and a majority of human communities being deprived of expertise. This is one of the greatest factors in the destruction of dynamic forces. Not only can people without expertise not find jobs, or only find jobs that are incompatible with their human dignity; even those with expertise destroy themselves from within as they have ceased to be whole beings. It is obvious that they become neglectful of their dignity and rights. To explain this, currently expertise—one of many human talents—dominates the entire domain of time, mind and action, the entire being. As a result, other talents do not have the opportunity to develop, and this starts to destroy the expert from within, making him/her an instrument of power.\n     \n\nIn contemporary societies, people are at the service of power. That is why those lacking expertise do not have the opportunity to develop a talent which will make them experts. It is obvious, when seven billion people, each of whom is a collection of talents, do not have the opportunity to coordinate their talents, that these talents can only be used in destruction. One can then only ask how much damage is done to humans and the environment due to the loss of opportunity for development. I know that some people talk about changing the structure of labour, but the realisation of the perfect human10 (which will be realised when humans are able to free themselves from being a labour force to be sold) is only to be achieved either when the ideal society is established or when the hours of labour are decreased and leisure time increased. Some even talk about changing the structure of labour in a way that would make it possible for people to participate directly in the leadership of society. Modern theories of social justice draw links between labour and human dignity. However, as it is a fact that humans are collections of talents, the structure of labour should be arranged to embrace all types of labour which are responsive to these talents. This, though, has not attracted much attention. It is obvious that within the principle of power it is impossible to imagine a person as a collection of talents, let alone suggest an open social system which is transformative and in harmony with human development. The truth is, the structure of labour in any society indicates the direction towards which dynamic forces are activated, and this direction tells us the measure of collective consciousness in regard to human dignity.\n 1. 11.\n    The spreading of poverty , people, nature, disease, financial corruption, the drug trade, and social crises and ills at a global level is a product of relations of domination . All these are legitimised, to varying degrees, within discourses of power. This reveals that the common denominator of discourses of power is a belief in the inability of humans to participate in social leadership, the assumption that they are ignorant and that they have an evil nature. Many social systems and institutions are based on these false beliefs. Excessive elitism, which is another element of expertise, is legitimised by the argument that the majority of people are incapable of managing their society and that they therefore need elites to rule them. Hence, the belief in ignorance, inability and the evil character of human nature have been used to legitimise social institutions on the basis of power. It is believed that humans are submissive to nature and that power is dominant. We can see this in the relationship between the state and the people, the party and party members, managers and workers, men and women within the family, and teachers and students.\n     \n\nEven when relationships should be based on friendship and love, beliefs of inability and deficiency still become legitimised to form a power relationship. For example, I have already mentioned that couples (men and women) are often not seen as a tawheed of excellence and talents. Here one should add that according to current social beliefs, a man and a woman are two imperfect beings that become perfect with marriage. What has been disregarded is the fact that two imperfect people could not become a perfect entity. Alternatively, women are viewed as incapable beings who become able through marriage and family. Even here, women are seen as seductive sexual objects who can be saved from seducing or being seduced by being within the family. It is obvious that the indicators of ability or disability are manifestations of power (e.g. money, position, authority of man over woman), despite the fact that human rights include both women’s and men’s rights.\nTherefore, a discourse of freedom is of utmost importance because it is a discourse in which men and women can regain their dignity and intrinsic rights, abilities and talents. In this discourse it is not belief in evil nature or intrinsic inequality which forms the structure of the relationship. Those in the minority that sees itself as the basis of power will realise that they have deprived themselves of their human dignity. Those who play the role of the flock will realise that their role was based on neglect of their dignity, and that they have to take much more responsibility. To become conscious of the fact that we are entities who have rights and dignity and to believe that no one is born evil or a sinner, to become conscious of one’s ability, talents and senses and hence to reconstruct social institutions based on this consciousness, is to develop along the right path, to recognise humanity in its totality.\n 1. 12.\n    Dignity will increase when identity is created in a nation, in the determination to live so that present moments embrace both past and future. Such a reconstruction of identity at both the individual and communal levels, in freedom , will increase dignity. Cultures will differ because they are the result of societies’ attempts to develop in their specific homelands. In other words, culture is a creation and invention of people in a homeland. In order to understand this more fully, we must be able to separate culture from anti-culture and realise that anything which is produced by power should be perceived as anti-culture. By making this distinction, we will realise that we not only have ‘a culture’, but many different cultures (multi-cultures). We will also realise that there is a wide common denominator among cultures which they can share in a universal culture.\n     \n\nHowever, it is deceptive, a fantasy, to assume that one culture can become universal, as it would be an anti-culture which tries to present itself as culture and deceive the dominated. It would be a deception because culture is creation, and when one exchanges culture like borrowed clothes, it is no more than assimilation and a reduction of culture to assimilation. This approach will not create people with superior culture, but will instead create impotent people. If we just differentiate, as I have argued, between the products of culture and anti-culture, we will see that not much is left of cultures that are supposed to produce people with abilities, dignity and rights. We can see how societies are rapidly desertifying, and observe a massive increase in identity crises. The overall crisis will be unlike any other in human history. Hence, the task we should undertake in order to develop human dignity is to differentiate culture and anti-culture, and gradually limit the domain of power and increase the space for dignified human thought and activities in order to create an identity through development.\n 1. 13.\n    According to the Koran , human beings have accepted a trusteeship in freedom . In life, no responsibility is higher than leadership in freedom, and no trusteeship is superior to that of dignifying life via development in freedom. A human who neglects his/her spiritual side is also neglectful of his/her freedom and dignity. It also bears repeating that discourses of power have turned human beings as leaders into instruments of power and depleted the world of dignity. That is why, in order to recognise the dignity of other beings, a person with dignity needs a discourse of freedom as guiding principle.\n     \n 2. 14.\n    Hence, if right aims to become the intermediary of humans, nature and the future, and humans aim to identify their right to dignity and nature, the contradiction which is currently the guiding principle of ideas and actions must be replaced with tawheed . Philosophies that perceive the material being as a product of contradiction have inevitably perceived humans as being determined by mutual contradictions. Of course, they therefore cannot recognise freedom , rights and dignity. The truth is that to accept the principle of dichotomy and contradiction when these become guiding principles is a negation of human rights and dignity. That is why in the relationship between freedom and the guiding principles of dichotomy, this contradiction has been resolved by defining freedom based on power.\n     \n\nWhen the Prophet of Islam began his mission, the principle of dichotomy was not yet universal; in our time it has become so. Everywhere—between groups and between human societies and nature—we are at war with each other, and this war has brought the world to the brink of collapse. According to a Club of Rome report, humans and nature could be in the last stages of their life (Von Weizsäcker 2009). That prediction is reminiscent of the Koran’s description of groups and cities which were destroyed when they did not turn from dichotomous principles to tawheed.\n> Such were the ‘Ad people: They rejected the Signs of their Lord and Cherisher; disobeyed His Apostles; And followed the command of every powerful, obstinate transgressor. … To the Thamud People (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: ‘O my people! Worship God! Ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein; then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him (in repentance): for my Lord is (always) near, ready to answer. … Oh my people! This she-camel of God is a symbol to you: leave her to feed on God’s (free) earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penalty will seize you!’ But they did ham-string her. So (Salih) said: ‘Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: (Then will be your ruin): (Behold) there a promise not to be belied!‘ When Our Decree issued We saved Salih and those who believed with him by (special) Grace from Ourselves − and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord − He is the Strong One, and able to enforce His Will. The (mighty) Blast overtook the wrong-doers, and they lay prostrate in their homes before the morning. (Koran 11:59, 61, 64−67)\n\nAfter the Hud people, the people of Ad and Thamud also replaced tawheed with unipolar dichotomy.11 They neglected their dignity and sought pleasure in dominating others and destroying animals and nature. Even when the last day came, they closed their eyes and ears to warnings until death overtook their towns.\nWhen we compare the principle which we can extract from these verses with the Club of Rome report cited above, one fundamental difference becomes apparent: the report’s authors neglected the fact that in today’s world, the guiding principle of individuals, groups and nations has become dichotomy. Therefore, their warning will get nowhere if people fail to realise that the source of their destructive attitudes is the dichotomous nature of the principles guiding their thinking and action.\nIn 1463, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola based his work On the Dignity of Man on a saying: ‘there is nothing to be seen more wonderful than man’ (Pico della Mirandola 2012: 109). He argued that this was the best description of humanism (see also Godin & Margolin nd). However, he neglected the fact that humans seek dignity through tawheed , freedom and rights. A large number of cultures and all parts of the culture which we call the culture of life are based on the principle of tawheed. The products of power are anti-culture, and they erode human beings because they lead them to neglect their dignity, rights, talents and abilities and reduce them to robots. This is happening to such an extent that today, a majority of people are unable to see the death of nature and fail to remember a basic fact of humanity that was immortalised in a poem by Sadi, a 13th-century Iranian poet. Sadi wrote that ‘all men are members of the same body, created from one essence. If fate brings suffering to one member, the other cannot stay at rest. You who remain indifferent to the burden of the pain of others do not deserve to be called human’ (Arberry 1945).\nBefore it is too late, before the principle of dichotomy, which functions as a despotic, stubborn, obstinate principle, comes to dominate all life, return to tawheed and find your true dignity.\nThe destruction from lack of tawheed and true dignity touched my life personally (writes Abol-Hassan Bani-Sadr, co-author of this book). When Iraq attacked Iran in 1980, and I had to defend the country with an army that was nearly dismantled, I hoped to be killed many times rather than see the country overrun by the Iraqi army. I wished I had been killed when my helicopter crashed, and not seen those days. However, because of my belief in life and dignity, I came to my senses and was filled with belief. I reproached myself for my death wish and found a solution by reminding myself of the dignity, courage, and ability of Iranian soldiers and officers. Astonishingly, despite the general belief that Iran would be defeated, not only was Iran not overrun by the Iraqi army, but the destiny of the war was changed in its first months. Therefore, I am well aware that it is hard to resist power in the search for dignity. However, by resisting these passing sentiments, one can transform them into eternity.\nOpen Access This chapter is licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http:// creativecommons. org/ licenses/ by/ 4. 0/ ), which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license and indicate if changes were made.\nThe images or other third party material in this chapter are included in the chapter’s Creative Commons license, unless indicated otherwise in a credit line to the material.

According to this understanding, the work of Buddhism is ‘not one of generating eternal and absolute answers to ultimate questions, but something much more modest and situationally specific.

At the same time, it is stressed that this book identified a range of diverse interpretations of dignity. For meaningful dialogue on the subject, it is therefore necessary to listen carefully and ascertain whether conversation partners are using the same or at least a similar concept of dignity. If not, fundamental disagreements can remain hidden to the detriment of constructive consensus.\nKeywords\nDignityMiddle eastDialogueSelf-worth\nThe Western concept of dignity has six very different interpretations, if one includes dignity as slogan .\n * Dignity as virtue : showing resilience, acceptance, poise, patience and endurance in the face of hardship, for instance.\n * Dignity as rank and position: the dignity of a senior politician or a senior cleric, for instance.\n * Dignity as comportment : not shouting and smoking in maternity wards, for instance.\n * Dignity as understood by Kant and expressed through his formula of humanity : those who have dignity can expect (or command as Kant would say) respect for their reasonable sense of purpose and self-worth.\n * God-given dignity: dignity equated with a sanctity of life as, for instance, in Catholicism.\n * Dignity as slogan: this cannot be defined precisely, but can be found in highly charged debates, for instance against new technologies,1 which are seen as an affront against human dignity.\n\nThe two main philosophical streams of Western dignity are dignity as virtue and dignity realised through the formula of humanity. We have extracted from them a common core, namely a sense of self-worth . Could this extension be applied to the Middle Eastern concept? Yes. Dignity as respect for and the protection of the self-worth of human beings is the core that could harmonise the main Western approaches to dignity with the Koranic interpretation.\nThe Koran , as interpreted in this book, encourages its readers to replace humiliation with dignity, leading to a deviolentisation of life. Dignity leads to peace , according to the Koran. In humiliating others, the Koran argues, one loses one’s own dignity. It also asks followers to develop their own dignity first, as a basis for recognising the dignity of others and acting upon this recognition. No one can revoke one’s own dignity, the Koran argues, but oneself. Recognising and developing one’s abilities, talents and senses belongs to the search for dignity. At the same time, one can help others develop and assist in their self-improvement and quest for dignity. Finally, striving towards dignity, according to the Koran, means that people need to be aware of their spiritual dimension and develop their related abilities in a constant effort to improve themselves. For instance, the inferiority of the social standing of women is an indication of social decadence and a sign that men’s dignity is not developed.\nFrom the above, one can see a strong similarity between dignity in the Koran and dignity as virtue , and in particular a strong emphasis on developing self-worth and assisting others in doing so. Human dignity is contingent upon the recognition of one’s own nobility (self-worth ) and others’ nobility. Neglect of other people’s dignity is a result of the neglect of one’s own, according to the Koran . For instance, corruption is an example of neglect for one’s own dignity.\nAt the outset of the book we quoted Fukuyama’s (2012) editorial commenting on the Arab Spring. He wrote: ‘The basic issue was one of dignity, or the lack thereof, the feeling of worth or self-esteem that all of us seek.’\nIt thus seems that one can find an inner kernel in dignity discussions that unites major Western and Middle Eastern streams: dignity as a sense of self-worth, which we have a duty to develop and respect in ourselves and a duty to protect in others.\nAt the same time, this book identified a range of diverse interpretations of dignity. For meaningful dialogue on the subject, it is therefore necessary to listen carefully and ascertain whether conversation partners are using the same or at least a similar concept of dignity. If not, fundamental disagreements can remain hidden to the detriment of constructive consensus.\nWe would like to end with a fictional dialogue.\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>4.1 Dignity—A Fictional Dialogue</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\nDoris Schroeder talking to a friend, a psychiatrist.\n * Friend: Did you ever write that book on dignity you told me about?\n * Doris: Yes.\n * With Bani-Sadr?\n * Yes.\n * How was it?\n * I am glad I didn’t write the book on my own.\n * Why?\n * I now have a stronger belief in the value of being precise, commonsensical and analytical in applied ethics and a stronger view on the limitations of this approach.\n * Why?\n * People often seem to make moral decisions based on unquestioned assumptions. And they mostly see their own situation and outlook. If one combines this attitude with a lack of empathy for others, some serious misjudgements can result.\n * Do you have an example?\n * There was one case I used for the book that I found profoundly sad and worrying. It was discussed using the term ‘dignity’. A 28-year old woman went to court to have her feeding tubes removed because she wanted to die.\n * Why?\n * She was suffering from a painful illness and was also quadriplegic.\n * What did the court decide?\n * They granted her request and allowed the removal of the tubes. She died.\n * Did you think this was wrong?\n * No. On the contrary, I do believe it is wrong to force artificial nutrition on somebody against their will.\n * So what was wrong?\n * The way the court approached the decision. And the obvious hidden assumptions the judges must have had.\n * What do you mean?\n * The judges showed no empathy with the young woman—who was called Elizabeth. They simply imagined what they would feel like if they were to go from presiding over a court to being quadriplegic and in pain.\n * And?\n * Their written judgement said that Elizabeth was ‘imprisoned and must lie physically helpless subject to the ignominy, embarrassment, humiliation and dehumanizing aspects created by her helplessness’.\n * I see what you mean.\n * To focus almost exclusively on Elizabeth’s helplessness and toileting needs under the topic of dignity is just wrong.\n * And what does this have to do with your belief in the value of analytical precision?\n * An applied ethicist who tries to be precise and starts from everyday occurrences or literature can bring out various dimensions in a concept, for instance in dignity.\n * Hmmm.\n * Dignity is often mentioned in the context of the dependency of severely ill or disabled people …\n * And?\n * And, I wish there was another word in this context. It seems wrong—to me—to use the word dignity both for Nelson’s Mandela’s comportment on Robben Island and in the context of incontinence.\n * I see.\n * It becomes dangerous when a concept that is imbued with almost mystical powers, such as the constitutional right to the inviolability of dignity, is suddenly used by judges who are pronouncing their views on the alleged humiliation of incontinence.\n * Don’t you understand the judges?\n * Yes, I do. But I believe that this is not right.\n * Let me read you something. It is about an old man talking to a middle-aged man over a chess game. The old man had been involved in the resistance against Salazar in Portugal. (She produces a paperback and then reads the excerpt given in this book’s introduction about the old man in a nursing home and his Swiss visitor (Mercier 2009: 364–365)).\n * You aren’t saying anything… It is moving, isn’t it?\n * Yes.\n * This man who had risen above his torturers despite unbearable agony could not cope with incontinence. The other man, Gregorius, analyses what dignity means for him and concludes: ‘And then you get worked up about a dirtied bed?’\n * Who is the author?\n * He is Peter Bieri, a Swiss professor of moral philosophy, but he writes novels under the pseudonym Pascale Mercier . What counts, though, is not the author but his main character. What Gregorius does show, in my view, is the value of precision and analysing concepts in applied ethics.\n * Yes?\n * Gregorius showed Eça that his intuitions about dignity and comportment and incontinence were incompatible with other understandings of dignity that he himself had adopted in an extreme situation.\n * And is that what your book is about? Showing the difference between these two concepts of dignity? The one about incontinence … well, you know what I mean, and the one about resisting torture?\n * Yes, that’s part of what I tried to do in my sections of the book. I termed one ‘comportment dignity’ and the other ‘dignity as virtue ’, but …\n * Wait a second… (She opens the paperback again.) Let me read something else to you. This time Gregorius is listening to a medical doctor:\n\n> The day before, I had informed a patient in the presence of his wife that he didn’t have long to live. You have to, I had persuaded myself before I called the two of them into the consulting room, they have to plan for themselves and the five children—and anyway: part of human dignity consists of the strength to look your fate, even a hard one, in the eye. … I took off my glasses and pinched the bridge of my nose between thumb and forefinger before I spoke. The two must have recognized the gesture as a harbinger of an awful truth, for when I looked up, they had grasped each other’s hands, which looked as if they hadn’t sought each other for decades. (Mercier 2009: 79–80)\n\n * Yes?\n * That’s a form of dignity as virtue, dignity in the face of hardship.\n * So are these the variations of dignity you came up with?\n * No, there are five, plus one outlier.\n * Five??!!\n * Yes. But don’t let me bore you with the details. What I hope to have shown is that these five concepts are strong and meaningful for many people and that they can contradict each other. It is therefore important to define them properly and make sure that discussants are talking about the same thing. And then there is a sixth one, dignity as slogan , which is indeed not meaningful.\n * How do you mean, ‘discussants’?\n * I mean people who are arguing about specific moral dilemmas, for instance, end-of-life decisions. If one is talking about comportment dignity and the other about a concept inspired by Catholic belief, which implies the sanctity of life , they will talk past each other.\n * Talk past each other?\n * One more. (Doris opens the paperback again.) Here is Gregorius once more.\n\n> I sat down in the lecture hall next to the Irish man. … It was unbelievable. The lecturer. … sketched in a creaky voice a casuistic of lying that couldn’t have been more nitpicking or farther from reality. … Can God create a stone He couldn’t lift? If not, then He isn’t almighty, if yes, then He isn’t either, for now there is a stone He cannot lift. That was the kind of scholasticism that poured forth into the room. … But that wasn’t what was really unbelievable. What was really incomprehensible was the discussion, as it was called. Cast into and enclosed in the gray lead frame of polite empty … phrases, the people spoke perfectly past one another. Constantly they said they understood each other, answered each other. But it wasn’t so. Not one, not a single one of the discussants, showed the slightest indication of a change of mind in view of the reasons presented. (Mercier 2009: 136–137)\n\n * If it goes well, analysing in applied ethics can illuminate concepts and help people avoid talking past each other. If that happens, people will change their minds, at least some of them. There will be some movement.\n * Does that work?\n * Not if people’s attitudes and opinions are narcistically cemented in stone and they are unwilling to listen to others.\n * So?\n * In addition to the analysis, there has to be a willingness to open one’s mind to others.\n * Is that where the limitations are?\n * Pardon?\n * You talked about the limitations of analytical philosophy before.\n * Yes.\n * That’s interesting.\n * I don’t know how one can instil a sense of empathy and imaginative caring in human beings, for instance in the judges who presided over Elizabeth’s fate. But I know that a sole focus on rational analysis will not suffice for fully rounded, well-balanced human interactions. But then, you are the psychiatrist.\n * And how does this relate to the book?\n * Do you remember something else I said earlier on?\n * What?\n * That I would like to co-author with an eminent scholar from an ancient culture, a highly respected politician known around the world?\n * Yes?\n * An excellent counterbalance against over-rationalising is input from a source that provides reflective scholarship rooted in a different culture, don’t you think?\n * Hmmm.\n * I have been lucky that Abol-Hassan Bani-Sadr co-authored this book.\n * Why?\n * Don’t you think so?\n * I just want to understand better what you mean.\n * But I already told you that wisdom and scholarship balance against over-rationalising. They make you think. Especially if you don’t understand everything immediately.\n * Hmmm. Perhaps you need to tell me more about the limitations of the analytical approach.\n * I believe there are three. The first is that one still needs judgement.\n * How do you mean?\n * Analytical philosophy cannot easily justify a preference between two equally coherent thought systems—for instance, to decide between dignity as virtue and dignity according to Kant if they were applied in specific cases.\n * Yes, I see what you mean. And the second limitation?\n * Perhaps that’s not really a limitation of analytical philosophy, more a limitation of analytical people who fail to show any empathy or common sense.\n * Empathy? Common sense? Are you thinking about changing careers and moving into my domain?\n * (Doris smiles.) Let me read something to you, written by a colleague of yours but for an applied ethics journal.\n\n> One case of mental disorder was encountered by a friend of mine, in an interview with a woman who had killed her infant. When asked why she had done it she gave the following explanation.\n>  1. 1.\n>     All human beings die and are judged\n>      \n>  2. 2.\n>     They are judged according to their sins\n>      \n>  3. 3.\n>     If they are found innocent, they live with God in heaven\n>      \n>  4. 4.\n>     Living with God in heaven is better than life on earth\n>      \n>  5. 5.\n>     My baby has committed no sins\n>      \n>  6. 6.\n>     If he dies, he will be innocent and go to heaven\n>      \n>  7. 7.\n>     Therefore, I killed my baby.\n>      \n\n> While it is clear that there is irrationality of a very profound kind here, it is not clear just how to categorise it. Premises 1, 2, and 3 are believed by a great many people and therefore each belief is ‘one ordinarily accepted by other members of the person’s culture or subculture.’ Premise 4 is found in some of the great religious works of Western Culture (e.g. Paul, Philippians 1:21). Premise 5 is a plausible premise on most readings by people who think in those terms, and 6 is merely a logical entailment of 2, 3, and 5. The practical conclusion comes as a surprise but, given the argument, the surprise is not explicable on purely rational grounds because the conclusion follows from premises that are widely believed by rational people. Nevertheless, we are not surprised that the argument was produced in justification by a woman accused of child murder and thought, by a psychiatrist examining her, to be suffering from psychosis. (Gillett 2003)\n\n * Do you see what I mean?\n * Yes.\n * I believe an over-emphasis on rationality and logic alone is detrimental in applied ethics, even if the degree is obviously different from the above disorder. But, for instance, it is not clear to me why philosophers do not work more often with psychologists and psychiatrists. On the topic of dignity that might be very fruitful.\n * Why?\n * Bani-Sadr and I came to the conclusion that there is an inner kernel that binds together the two main Western conceptions of dignity (dignity as virtue and the Kantian understanding of not instrumentalising other people) and dignity as seen in the Koran . It is dignity as a sense of self-worth , which we have a duty to develop and respect in ourselves and a duty to protect in others.\n * How could psychologists or psychiatrists help?\n * You know that, don’t you?\n * I do, but I am interested to hear what you think.\n * I found an interesting analysis of human dignity in a psychology book. What the psychologists did was to name the four scourges that harm dignity (Fig. 4.1). The first scourge is violence. Those humans who can defend themselves against violence can protect their dignity, but if you are a child, for instance, or a person who cannot escape for some reason, constant violence will make you feel smaller and smaller and ever more helpless, until, in the end, you have lost your sense of self-worth . Let me read something from the book:\n\n> Somebody who is regularly unable to defend themselves tends towards losing all hope of a solution or exit and starts to accept the loss of self-worth and the sense of dignity. How are you meant to feel when you are beaten all the time and when your personal boundaries are not respected? Losing your sense of self-worth can become natural, and helplessness becomes the terrible normality. (Baer and Frick-Baer 2009: 12, DS translation)\n\n * The second scourge is humiliation . That is something philosophers have worked on in relation to dignity, especially an Israeli philosopher called Margalit. But it was still good to see it in the psychology book. The authors say that humiliation begins where people are made smaller through words or behaviour. They give the example of a boy who hears all the time: ‘You’ll be nobody, you’ll end up as a bin man,’ and loses all sense of self-worth over the years (Baer and Frick-Baer 2009: 13). They write:\n\n> Humiliations are part of everyday life for many people. If they happen only occasionally, people can normally defend themselves successfully and can find a way to cope with the denigration. The main danger occurs in the repetition and in the continuity. Where people are continuously subjected to humiliation, this experience trickles into their image of themselves and the sense of one’s own dignity can get lost. (Baer and Frick-Baer 2009: 15, DS translation)\n\n * The third scourge is disregard. Do you agree with this one? It doesn’t seem as obvious to me as the others:\n\n> From a psychological perspective, it is obvious. Humans are very social beings; to be ignored and disregarded systematically is very difficult for the human psyche. (Baer and Frick-Baer 2009: 15, DS translation)\n\n * That’s what the psychologists in the book say. They give a case example where parents ignored their child for a week after some wrongdoing or after a low grade at school. And the child said ‘I was treated like thin air for a week. That was terrible. I yearned to be shouted at.’ (Baer and Frick-Baer 2009: 16, DS translation). The psychologists write:\n\n> To be ignored and not to receive answers or comments to what one says – these are heavy punishments and they can make people suffer a lot. (Baer and Frick-Baer 2009: 16, DS translation)\n\n * The fourth scourge is embarrassment. To me that sounded a lot like the second one, humiliation , but the examples given made the difference clear. What do you think?\n * What were the examples?\n * One case recalled how a child was constantly embarrassed and on edge because the father regularly got drunk in public. She said, ‘When my father had one of his binges, I was so incredibly ashamed. I found this so undignified. … Later I despised him. And I had terrible stomach pains. … A little bit of my dignity died in my stomach.’ (Baer and Frick-Baer 2009: 18, DS translation)\n * Yes, that’s a good example. Humiliation is usually meant when a particular person is targeted, but you can feel serious embarrassment unrelated to yourself, or at least not directly related to yourself, as in this case.\n   Fig. 4.1\n   Harming dignity: the four scourges\n * The other reason I liked the analysis from the psychologists was the obvious link to Bani-Sadr’s thoughts on dignity. They spoke about power, as he did. There is one section in particular, where Bani-Sadr writes that freedom and human rights will become casualties if human relationships are built on power.\n * And the psychologists?\n * They write that many people who feel defenceless and vulnerable do so because other people’s power has wounded them permanently through humiliation and violations of dignity.\n * So, yes, I can see how this is all coming together: dignity according to the Koran , dignity as virtue , dignity as not instrumentalising others. So what next?\n * This is probably the place where one should ask, ‘Which book next?’\n * And?\n * I think my answer to ‘What next?’ is ‘Do something practical, don’t just write about it.’\n\nOpen Access This chapter is licensed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http:// creativecommons. org/ licenses/ by/ 4. 0/ ), which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license and indicate if changes were made.\nThe images or other third party material in this chapter are included in the chapter’s Creative Commons license, unless indicated otherwise in a credit line to the material.
