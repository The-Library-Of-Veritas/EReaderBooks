      "content": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis translation was begun in 1968 as research in an area of great personal interest. As a Chinese with an undergraduate major in Western literature and a graduate concentration in English and Philosophy, I was particularly interested in bringing these two cultural worlds together in a philosophical setting. As professor of Non-Western Philosophy and Chinese Philosophy at Southern University, I found a tremendous source of input from my students. Many of them expressed a keen interest in studying the works of Lao Tzu, although warned beforehand that such an endeavor required a rigorous examination of ideas foreign to the Westerner in thought and structure. One who drank deeply of the sweet and the bitter in her intense study of Lao Tzu was the late Ms. Lois A. Miller.\n\nIn December 1974, in the course of sending season’s greetings to many of my friends and former professors, I attached questionnaires focusing on certain problem areas of the text of the Tao Te Ching, of Wang Pi’s commentary and of Ho Shao’s biography of Wang Pi. Not only were the responses enthusiastic, but if one friend had doubts about answering a question, he in turn sent letters to his friends and professors asking for their opinions. These respondents covered a wide geographic area and included both Chinese and non-Chinese, and their answers could easily become the basis of another entire book. Their responses not only show the universality of scholarship and interest in this ancient metaphysical philosophy, but also have inspired me to dig deeper and think harder to reconcile differences in interpretation. Having troubled so many friends and friends of friends and made demands on their valuable time and energy, I wish I could acknowledge each of them here. But since they are too numerous to be mentioned in this limited space, I will simply say that without their contribution, the value of this work would have been greatly reduced. I would like to thank, however, the following people who guided me in their particular areas of expertise: Professors K. H. Chan, Constant C. C. Chang, Ch’en Tsu-wen, Chow Ts’e-tsung; Charles C. L. Fan, Charles Wei-hsun Fu, Ho Chiew-ts’ung, Hsiao Ch’un-po, Hsu Chia-pi, Louis S. Illar, Jao Tsung-i, Kao Yueh-t’ien, Li Tche-houa, Lin Wen-chouh, Liu Shu-hsien, Wang Chao-nan Ho, Wang Fan-yu, Wang Teh-chao, Wong Yuk, Wu Yi, Yang Chialo, Yang Lien-sheng, and Yen Lingfeng. My appreciation also goes to the administration of Southern University for providing much-needed facilities and clerical help and to Dr. Huel D. Perkins, Dean of the College of Arts and Humanities, for his encouragement.\n\nAny work of this scope must involve one’s immediate family, and mine was especially helpful throughout the manuscript’s preparation. My wife, Ch’en San-su, who majored in Chinese language and literature at Peking University and in English at Teachers College, Columbia University, went over the entire manuscript and offered many helpful suggestions. My daughter Betty, who has studied the Chinese language, assisted in some of the translation. And my daughter Jeannie, an English major and editorial assistant, edited the manuscript from beginning to end. Her sensitivity to language usage and to the poetic element of the original work were crucial in bringing this translation to its final shape and format.\n\nFinally, the high point of writing any book comes with its publication. I am indebted to the staff of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan—in particular, Albert Feuerwerker, Rhoads Murphey, Don Munro, Rosalind Daly, JoAnne Browder, Mary Kelly, and Dorothy Perng—for their aid in publishing this work in the Michigan Papers in Chinese Studies series.\n\nAny manuscript, regardless of the amount of care put into it, will contain errors. It is my hope, however, that any reader who finds such errors will write to enlighten me so that revision can be made in the future. And though, as I have emphasized, this book is the result of vast team effort, I alone take full responsibility for any mistakes or transgressions.\n\nPaul J. Lin"

      "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the Spring-Autumn period (722-480 B.C.) and the time of the Warring States (480-222 B.C.), China was in great turmoil. Intellectuals and social reformers sifted through their wisdom and the experiences of China’s already lengthy past, attempting to find a solution to their situation. Because the passing of time has obscured their meanings, our attempts to understand the works they produced often lead to questions, many of which can be answered only through careful speculation.\n\nMore than any other work, Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching raises numerous questions concerning authorship, organization, chapter divisions, possible incorporation of the commentaries into the original text, etc. The difficulty is further complicated by the obscuring of philosophical meanings due to the nature of the Chinese language and the technological facilities available for recording the contents, making the exact content and order of the original impossible to verify. Also from a historical perspective, this work has been subject to possible alteration from two major sources, different schools of thought which claimed the book as their own and often made additions favoring their positions, and various commentators and annotators who attempted to influence the thinking of scholars studying their works. We will therefore begin by examining the limitations of language and technology, the additions of varying schools of thought, and the influence of different commentators.\n\nConcerning technological limitations, paper and the art of printing had not yet been invented when the original text was recorded. Most sinologists agree that ancient books like the Tao Te Ching were handcopied. Moreover, it is probable that before they were written down, they were passed on verbally. The Tao Te Ching, for example, was written in verse, and it is speculated that the use of rhyme made the text easier for people to remember and recite. Due to this possible oral origin, most scholars are uncertain of the authorship and date of the Tao Te Ching, and are not even sure that it was created by a single author.1\n\nMost of the classics were first recorded on bamboo or wood strips which varied in length (20 to 40 cms), width (1 to 3 cms), and thickness (.15 to .25 cms); the size was determined by the material used and the individual craftsman. Furthermore, the number of strips per literary unit and the number of words per strip were not consistent; generally each strip had one line of writing and each line had between 10 and 20 words, written in ink or varnish. The strips needed to comprise a unit, a group of units, a book, or even several books, were bound together with hemp and stored in bamboo chests. The hemp and the bamboo chests would rot over a period of time, making it difficult to determine the order of the original. Furthermore, the only way to duplicate a book was through handcopying, in the process of which different calligraphers might inadvertently substitute incorrect characters that were close to the original in appearance. Characters could also be omitted or added, and even the arrangement of chapters might be mixed up. These factors increase our difficulty in determining the original text.\n\nThe earliest copies of the book of Lao Tzu were-probably not divided into parts or chapters and had no subtitles. In later versions, the work was divided into books and chapters in various ways. Modern versions are usually divided into either two or four sections, two parts representing the male (yang) and the female (yin) or heaven (t’ ien) and earth (ti), and four sections representing the four seasons—spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The number of chapters is either 72, which is the product of 8 times 9, the highest even and odd numbers below 10, or 81, which is the product of 9 times 9, the symbol of the sun.\n\nSinologists believe that before the Ch’in dynasty (221–207 B.C.), there were already three versions of Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching. The first was the original written by Lao Tzu, containing over 5,000 words and divided roughly into 81 parts. The other two versions were divided into two major sections—the Tao Ching and the Te Ching—and reflected changes made by different schools of thought. The versions which placed the Tao Ching first reflected a metaphysical orientation, while the one that placed the Te Ching first reflected a Legalist slant. The accepted arrangement today is to place the Tao Ching before the Te Ching.\n\nWe must also realize that different schools of thought have made additions on their own behalf. The most recent example of this phenomenon was discovered in the People’s Republic of China in November 1973-January 1974. In the Han Tombs on Ma-Wang-Tui (Horse king heights), Changsha, Hunan, two ancient and previously lost editions of the Tao Te Ching were unearthed.2 Both were written with brush and ink on silk.\n\nThe first of these silk books was found on a piece of wood about 24 cms high, which included four ancient lost books without titles. There were a total of 463 lines and over 13,000 words. The book has been dated between 206 and 195 B.C., based on the type of characters used (the small-seal style) and the fact that the name of Liu Pang (247-195 B.C.) was not avoided.3 The second book was found in a varnished box about 48 cms high and included the four books of Fa Ching (The classic of law), The Ten Great Ching, The Title, and The Sources of Tao. There were a total of 32 pieces of silk, 252 lines, and more than 16, 000 words. Because the second book was written in clerical style characters and avoided the use of Liu Pang’s name (but not the names of Liu Ying (207-188 B.C.) and Liu Hung (202-157 B.C.)), it has been dated between 194 and 180 B.C. Neither book had chapters or chapter headings. Both put the Te Ching before the Tao Ching, reflecting a Legalist slant. The second book had a total of 5,466 words, close to the number of words in modern versions of the Tao Te Ching.\n\nDuring the time the silk books were written, the political system was based on Legalist thought, but the conception of how government was controlled (e.g., the only task of the monarch is to appoint able officials) corresponded to the metaphysical thinking of Huang Ti and Lao Tzu. During Wang Pi’s time, emphasis was placed on metaphysics and philosophical interpretations, and human affairs, economics, and social relations were linked to Tao. The major differences between the Ma-Wang-Tui editions and Wang Pi’ s editions of the Tao Te Ching are detailed in Appendix III.\n\nThe Tao Te Ching may be regarded as a metaphysical book, that is, a source of the highest political thought. Some readers have found in it high principles on human affairs and claimed that it is possible to write different books by focusing on different topics. This is precisely what past annotators and commentators have done. Moreover, those who disagreed with the accepted arrangement of the book have tried to rearrange it according to language style and ideas, grouping sentences on the basis of subject matter and then dividing them into chapters.4 This of course creates inherent problems in trying to interpret the Tao Te Ching, such as determining exactly if and where commentaries have been incorporated into the original text. It is generally accepted, for example, on the basis of a careful examination of meanings and language used, that Wang Pi’ s commentary has been integrated into Chapters 31 and 66, and that in Chapter 32 his commentary has been partially combined with the text.\n\nWhy are annotations and commentaries necessary for an understanding of the Tao Te Ching? One reason is that it deals with profound and mystical principles which intrigue annotators and commentators and inspire them to trace the book’s sources, analyze its meaning, and search for possible application to their own ideas. These secondary sources sometimes founded schools of thought and became objects of commentary themselves.5 In addition to its profound meanings and ideas, Lao Tzu’ s book also uses language which is highly condensed, paradoxical, and metaphorical. Lao Tzu wrote in a cryptic manner, hinting at his meaning without ever revealing it fully. He emphasized one element to show the importance of the opposite; thus he said in Chapter 78, line 13, “True words seem paradoxical.” His statements, each stressing one aspect of life while ignoring the others, often seem disconnected. An expression may deny what other expressions affirm while affirming what other expressions deny. Meaning seems to lurk beneath the surface of his expressions and the terse paradoxical language allows many interpretations for a single word. Chapter 21, line 10, word 4 provides a good example of this:\n\n\n\nHo-shang-kung, Wang Pi, Wang Huai, etc. By this the beginning of all things is known. (fu is interpreted as beginning) Ku Huan, Li Jung, Fan Ying-yüan, etc. fu is interpreted as the origin Lin Hsi-i, Chiao Hung, Hsiao Ch’un-po, etc. fu is interpreted as beauty Hu Ju-chang and Li Kung-ch’ in fu is interpreted as process of change Li Chih, Wei Yuan, Chung Ying-mei, etc. fu is interpreted as all being, entity, or existence Chiang Hsi-ch’ ang fu is interpreted as human beings, mankind Ma Hsü-lun, Chang Mo-sheng, Ho Chien-ts’ung, etc. fu is interpreted as father Chu Ch’ien-chih fu is interpreted as great Wu Ching-yu fu is interpreted as the Sage\n\nConsequently an annotator or commentator has ample room to develop his own interpretation, resulting in greater difficulty in getting at the “true meaning” of the original work.\n\nAside from the cryptic style of the writing, the nature of the Chinese language itself creates difficulty in interpreting the Tao Te Ching. The Chinese language is ideographic and pictographic, each word forming a picture, but lacking inflectional elements to denote grammatical classifications. Sentence structure relies exclusively on word order and context. The subject-predicate syntactic structure so basic in English and other Indo-European languages is nonexistent in ancient Chinese; furthermore there are no punctuation marks in ancient Chinese manuscripts. Thus a subject or verb may be missing or the end of a sentence unclearly marked. To identify the subject, predicate, and grammatical relationships, one must study the syntax and word order. To identify the speaker and his audience, one must know syntactic, logical, and even metaphorical relationships. It is no wonder the Chinese commentators often share the same difficulties experienced by non-Chinese scholars and translators in interpreting the Tao Te Ching.\n\nThe following example illustrates the difficulties created by a lack of punctuation (Chapter 1, lines 5–6).\n\n\n\nWang Pi and Ho-shang-kung Therefore constantly without desire, There is the recognition of subtlety; But constantly with desire, Only the realization of potentiality. Wang An-shih and Kao Heng Therefore constantly based on non-being, one will have insight into its subtlety; Constantly based on being, one will have insight into its potentiality.\n\nThe former makes a break after desire (yü) in both lines, using it as a noun; it is the traditional explanation based on human experience or pragmatism, belonging to the realm of epistemology emphasizing desire. The latter makes a break before desire (yü), using it as a verb; it is based on ontological practice, belonging to the realm of ontology emphasizing insight.\n\nAn example of the difficulty inherent in Chinese syntax comes from the last two lines of Chapter 49.\n\n\n\nThe first line has at least two interpretations: (1) the people themselves take care of their own ears and eyes (i.e., are concerned with their own selfish desires); and (2) the people look at and hear the Sage (i.e., pay attention to the Sage). This ambiguity is made possible by the possessive pronoun ch’i, which can refer to the people or the Sage. The second line clearly indicates that the Sage regards all people as infants. The following sample gives an idea of the differing ways in which these two lines have been handled:\n\nOrde Poynton Wise Men shut themselves away because the world confuses their minds: Wise Men are all children. Archie J. Bahm All people admire the intelligent man, Because he regards them all as a mother regards her children. Feng Gia-fu and Jane English Men look to him and listen He behaves like a little child. C. Spurgeon Medhurst Most men plan for themselves. The Holy Man treats every one as a child. Arthur Waley The Hundred Families all the time strain their eyes and ears, The Sage all the time sees and hears no more than an infant sees and hears. John C. H. Wu All the people strain their ears and eyes: The Sage only smiles like an amused infant. James Legge The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children. Lin Yutang The people of the world are brought into a community of heart, And the Sage regards them all as his own children. Chan Wing-tsit They (the people) all lend their eyes and ears, and he treats them all as infants. Ch’u Ta-kao Yet what all the people turn their ears and eyes to, The Sage looks after as a mother does her children. This translation The people all strain their ears and eyes. And the Sage regards them all as infants.\n\nMost Chinese scholars, such as Wu, Chan, and Ch’u, translate the first line based on the various meanings of the words, and the translation of the second line on ideas from other sections of the book as well as from the interpretation of the first line. Chapter 3, lines 7–8, for example, reads: “Therefore in governing, the Sage empties the people’s hearts and fills their stomachs”; and Chapter 12, lines 6–7, reads: “Therefore the Sage provides for the belly and not for the eyes.” Wang Pi’s interpretation of these two lines is: although the Sage does not provide for the eyes of the people, he still does not have anything for himself (he does not have his own heart since his heart is the people’s heart) and regards the people as infants. Consequently, as stated in Chapter 17, lines 8–9, “When he (the Sage) accomplishes his task and the things get done,/The people all say: ‘We have done it by ourselves.’”\n\nProblems in interpretation may also arise when a character has different pronunciations and therefore different meanings depending on its usage. While Chinese scholars may draw on their cultural background to resolve this problem, non-Chinese scholars may find this feature of Chinese language puzzling. For example, in Chapter 80, lines 4–5 read:\n\n\n\nThe third word, chung, has at least two pronunciations and meanings. It may be pronounced chùng, meaning heavy, mighty, important, or serious. Or it may be pronounced ch’ung, meaning repetition or again. Below are different translations which result from these different meanings6 (emphasis added):\n\nOrde Poynton So that though there may be a heavy death rate yet the people do not fly to distant places: Arthur Waley He could bring it about that the people would be ready to lay down their lives and lay them down again7 in defence of their homes, rather than emigrate.\n\nC. Spurgeon Medhurst They should be made to comprehend the gravity of death and the futility of emigration. R. B. Blakney Where people die and die again but never emigrate; Lin Yutang Let the people value their lives8 and not migrate far. Ch’u Ta-kao I will make the people regard death as a grave matter and not go far away. Chan Wing-tsit Let the people value their lives9 highly and not migrate far. John C. H. Wu Let them (the people) mind death and refrain from migrating to distant places. This translation Let the people weigh death heavily and have no desires to move far away.\n\nAs has been illustrated, commentators and annotators naturally had different interpretations of the same lines. Readers of the Tao Te Ching have found that a careful examination of the commentaries is necessary in tracking down its essential meanings. Their job is not easy, however, since\n\naccording to statistics, known Chinese commentaries on the Tao Te Ching presently total more than 600. On the average, for every seven words of the text, someone has written a book of explanation.10\n\nIn discussing the contribution of commentaries to an understanding of the Lao Tzu, we should consider the remark of Su Tung-po (1036–1101) in praise of his younger brother’s commentary:\n\nIf, during the Warring States period, we had had this book, then there would have been no Shang Yang or Han Fei (that is, no need for a Legalist school). If it had existed during the early Han dynasty, then Confucianism and Taoism would be one. If it had existed during the Chin and Sung dynasties, then Buddhism and Taoism would not have separated.11\n\nThe passage asserts not only the importance of a commentary, but also the deep influence which Lao Tzu’s book was considered to have over Chinese politics, religion, and cultural developments. In fact, the importance of the commentaries in helping the reader to understand Lao Tzu’s writing can hardly be exaggerated, especially for translators who are trying to render those meanings in another language.\n\nWang Pi’s contribution to Chinese philosophy in general and Taoism in particular will now be examined. Wang Pi’s remarkable scholarship has been noted by Chinese historians and philosophers throughout history. His thoughts will be discussed here in terms of three basic topics—the basic metaphysical problem of being and non-being, the relationship of substance and function according to his interpretation of the Great Expansion,12 and the Sage and his emotions—which are actually aspects of a single problem, the interpretation of being vs. non-being.\n\nAccording to Ho Shao (see Appendix II), Wang Pi, when asked about the problem of being and non-being, skillfully followed the philosophical school then in vogue (Confucianism) and answered: “The Sage (Confucius (557-479 B.C.)) embodies non-being, but non-being cannot be taught. Hence he does not discuss it. While Lao Tzu is for being, he constantly discusses its insufficiency.” Taken at surface value, these words seem to emphasize the Sage and to favor Confucian thought, thus referring to “sageliness within and kingliness without.”13 In actuality, here “sageliness within” alludes to the thinking of Lao Tzu, while “kingliness without” refers to Confucian concepts on how to govern a nation and put the world in order. Wang Pi tried to reconcile these two schools of thought and of course was attacked from both sides. Some were dissatisfied that he used Taoist concepts to interpret the I Ching, thus drawing on Lao Tzu to interpret Confucius. Others attacked him for emphasizing the importance of the Sage (Confucius), thereby interpreting Taoism by Confucian concepts. The strength of attacks from both sides merely indicates the extent of his provocative and substantial contributions to the field.\n\nOn first reading, Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching seems full of contradictions and inconsistencies, almost a disorderly collection of aphorisms with no structure or organization. Furthermore, the two sections of the book, the Tao Ching and the Te Ching, seem to be unrelated to each other. However, a careful reading of Wang Pi’s commentary can help the scholar to understand what relationships do exist. For example, in Chapter 1, lines 3–4 read: “The Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth;/The Namable is the mother of all things.” The same idea is expressed in Chapter 2:\n\nTherefore, being and non-being beget each other,\n\nhard and easy complement each other,\n\nlong and short shape each other,\n\nhigh and low rely on each other,\n\nsound and voice harmonize with each other,\n\nfront and back follow each other.\n\nThe meaning becomes clear only when this passage is examined in totality. The determination of low must rely on high. Being and non-being, easy and hard, and so on—each contributes to the meaning of its opposite. If one is omitted, the other becomes meaningless. How can we have hard if we do not have the easy? This differentiation is part of a natural process in which substance and function are one.\n\nTao (substance) and Te (function) must be considered as one. Tao is where everything comes from, and Te is what everything obtains. Tao is the origin; Te is the end. While origin and end can be separated in principle, they should be considered as two in one. If there is no substance, how can there be function? If there is no outcome, how can one know its origin? Front and behind, for example, are determined by contrast. When we say that this is in front of that, we are actually considering the back; so in order to recognize the front, we must be aware of the back. When we say something is long, we are mindful of the concept of shortness; only because it is not short do we know that it is long. If we compare it with something longer, it becomes short. The statement in Chapter 2, line 1, “When all in the world recognize beauty as beauty, it is ugliness,” is extraordinary. If applied to its extreme, we would be unable to distinguish between good and bad or beauty and ugliness, because they are all, in a sense, two sides of the same thing. If substance and function are considered as one, then everything produced from them cannot be differentiated.\n\nThe following example from Chapter 11, lines 1–3, discusses the oneness of substance and function in both text and commentary.\n\nThirty spokes converge in a nave;\n\njust because of its nothingness (void)\n\nthe usefulness of the cart exists.(1)\n\n(1). A nave can unite the thirty spokes because of its void. From its void, it is able to receive all things. Therefore it can unite them.\n\nAnd from Chapter 1, lines 5–8 and commentary,\n\nTherefore constantly without desire,\n\nThere is the recognition of subtlety;(3)\n\nBut constantly with desire,\n\nOnly the realization of potentiality.(4)\n\n(3). Subtlety is infinitely small. All things originate from ultimate smallness and later achieve completion, begin from nothingness and then grow. Therefore constantly void of desire and empty, one may discern the mystery of the origin of things.\n\n(4). Potentiality returns to the ultimate. All benefits of being must be based on the usefulness of non-being. Desire must be rooted in Tao in order to prevail. Therefore one constantly has desires in order to see the potential of ultimate things.\n\nFinally from Chapter 11, lines 10–11,\n\nTherefore, profit from that which exists\n\nand utilize that which is absent.\n\nMetaphysically, the principles of substance and function are separate but also one. Practically, substance or non-being should be the principle in the use of all things. Being is the function of substance; applied to all things, it will benefit everything that exists. That is to say, “The Tao of heaven is to benefit others without hurting them” (Chapter 81, lines 12–13).\n\nThus substance and function are one. The Great Expansion consists of 50 numbers. Of these, the One is not used. According to Wang Pi, it is not used so that all useful things may draw their usefulness from it. Although not a number like other numbers, all numbers are completed by it. In the Great Expansion, only 49 numbers are used. According to Wang Pi, non-being (the One) cannot express itself, but must rely on being (the 49). Hence one knows the fundamental relation between the One and the many, or the substance and the function.14\n\nWhat does Wang Pi say of the Sage and his emotions? From Chapter 2, lines 11–16, we find:\n\nTherefore, the Sage administers without action(2)\n\nand instructs without words.\n\nHe lets all things rise without dominating them,\n\nproduces without attempting to possess,\n\nacts without asserting, (3)\n\nachieves without taking credit.(4)\n\n(2). To be natural is quite enough; to exert means to defeat.\n\n(3). Wisdom and knowledge are innate; to strive for them is false (to nature).\n\n(4). Abiding by their natural functions, all things will achieve their own fulfillment; hence one cannot take any credit.\n\nAnd from Chapter 49, lines 1-2,\n\nThe Sage has no constant heart (mind).\n\nHe takes the people’s heart as his heart.(1)\n\n(1). To move constantly is to follow.\n\nWe see from these passages Wang Pi’s emphasis on the importance of “following” in the role of the Sage.\n\nChapter 29, note 2, states, “The virtue of all things is based on nature.” The Sage reaches the ultimate in nature, flowing through the passions of all things. Here we realize that according to Wang Pi, the Sage must have emotions. Without them, he cannot reach the ultimate in nature. The nature of the Sage is further developed in Chapter 81, where Lao Tzu’s and Wang Pi’s ideas are merged and crystallized.\n\nThe Sage does not store things for himself.(4)\n\nThe more one does for others,\n\nThe more he has for himself.(5)\n\nThe more one gives to others,\n\nThe more he keeps for himself.(6)\n\nThe Tao of heaven is to benefit others\n\nwithout hurting them.(7)\n\nThe Tao of the Sage is to act without competing.(8)\n\n(4). Without selfishness, one is self-sufficient; giving only to the good and leaving (other) things alone.\n\n(5). That is what all things respect.\n\n(6). That is how all things return to him\n\n(7). It always moves to produce and complete.\n\n(8). Follow the benefit of heaven and never harm each other.\n\nIn our lack of understanding, we tend to categorize and make divisions in interpreting life. Wang Pi’s meticulous and profound comments show that human affairs cannot be separated from the way of heaven. Everything can be seen as two manifestations of one, and one cannot be divided. This is Wang Pi’s contribution to the interpretation of the Lao Tzu and the reason why his commentary is considered a model of discernment. His deep influence cannot be taken as a chance event, but rather the result of profound insight into the meaning of Taoism.\n\nThere are now over seventy or eighty translations of Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching, most of which are based on Wang Pi’s edition of the Lao Tzu. Translations have been done in so many different languages that every language has at least one version. The Tao Te Ching has, for example, already been translated into English forty-four times. A new version has appeared about every other year during the last twenty years, with half of them in the United States.15 Projecting this further, we can estimate that a new version of this book will emerge at the rate of one per year. Why then have we done yet another translation of the Tao Te Ching? Part of my purpose in translating this book was to trace the original meanings of both Lao Tzu and Wang Pi as faithfully as possible, showing the interrelationship between the original verse and Wang Pi’s comments.\n\nThe Chinese feel that there are two commentaries on the Tao Te Ching worth noting, one by Ho-shang-kung and the other by Wang Pi. Ho-shang-kung’s commentary has already been translated into English,16 but no translation of Wang Pi’s commentary has appeared even though his is considered the older of the two and therefore closer to Lao Tzu’s thought. While Ho-shang-kung had a religious Taoist slant dealing with such issues as attaining longevity, Wang Pi presented an intellectual philosophical viewpoint, and for this reason is often considered the more authentic of the two.17\n\nArthur Waley remarked on Wang Pi’s commentary as follows:\n\nAll the commentaries, from Wang Pi’s onwards down to the 18th century are “scriptural”; that is to say that each commentator reinterprets the text according to his own particular tenets, without any intention or desire to discover what it meant originally. From my point of view they are therefore useless.18\n\nEach individual translator relies on his own learning, background, common sense, and insights to discover the original meaning of Lao Tzu. Each interpretation therefore has its own bias, but we cannot discount a commentator because his interpretations are different. I agree with R. B. Blakney, who says:\n\nI suspect that nearly every foreigner in China who has taken the trouble to study this collection of mystical poems has felt the same way: so many translations of it have appeared. For one reason or another each translation, in its turn, fails fully to satisfy one who knows the original, and at length, one tries his own hand at it. Will he, in his turn, satisfy? Probably not; but he may add his share to the ultimate understanding of one of the world’s truly distinguished religious works.19\n\nI also agree with Chan Wing-tsit’s comment that “It is highly desirable to have a translation of Wang Pi’s commentary.”20\n\nMy final reason for this translation was to explore through the use of everyday language how Chinese and English can relate to each other—to fathom the relationships between words and meanings in both languages and to test the elasticity and resourcefulness of American idioms and expressions in an attempt to preserve the Chinese meanings and poetic elements of the original without sacrificing readability to the Western reader. In so doing, I hope I have helped the reader to catch a glimpse of not only the thought of Lao Tzu, but also the logic and genius of the Chinese language.\n\nThe first part of this book is my translation of the Tao Te Ching, along with Wang Pi’s commentary arranged in note form. My main source was the Okada version of the Tao Te Ching, but I used six other versions—Kondo, the Orthodox Tao-ts’ang, Ssu Pu Pei Yao, Sun, T’ang, and Usami—as cross-references. My own comments, marked by asterisks, come after the commentary. Whenever possible, I have tried to note the specific passages that have been sources of error or controversy among different translators. I have also tried to point out significant philosophical and historical correlations.\n\nFor those readers who wish to know something about the lives of Lao Tzu and Wang Pi as presented by writers who lived closer to their times, I have included Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s “Collective Biography of Lao Tzu” and Ho Shao’s “Biography of Wang Pi” (see Appendices I and II). The biography of Lao Tzu is in itself an intriguing work which presents Lao Tzu more as a legend than a man. The biography of Wang Pi is a collection of short notes which show that Wang Pi’s life, although short (he died at twenty-four), was full of splendor. Some say that he understood the meaning of Taoism so profoundly that life and death made no difference to him and that, by “dying without extinction” (Chapter 33), he attained a type of immortality. For practical purposes, his immortality is evident in the distinguished commentary he left behind.\n\nAppendix III is a detailed listing of the major differences between Ma-Wang-Tui’s and Wang Pi’s editions of the Tao Te Ching. The recent archaeological discovery at Ma-Wang-Tui21 shows the Legalist school of thought as applied to Lao Tzu’s writings and makes this comparison/contrast interesting and informative.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. For instance, Chapter 6 of the Tao Te Ching appeared in The Book of Lieh Tzu and was apparently taken from The Book of the Yellow Emperor. See Lionel Giles’ translation of Taoist Teachings from the Book of Lieh Tzu, Book I, “Cosmogony,” p. 17.\n\n2. For further reference, see Kao Heng and Ch’ih Hsi-chao, “Notes on the Silk Manuscript Text(s) of Laotzu Found in the Han Tomb No. 3 at Ma-Wang-Tui, Changsha,” Peking: Wen Wu (Cultural relics), No. 11 (total no. 222), November 1974, pp. 1–7.

The emperor could not be referred to by name after his term of office. The first silk book was dated before or during Liu Pang’s term because his name was not avoided. The second book was dated after his term because his name was avoided.\n\n4. See, for example, Yen Ling-feng, A New Compilation of the Four Writers of Taoism, or Cheng Lin, The Works of Lao Tzyy, Truth and Nature. Professor Yen’s writings are a major influence on the newest generation of Taoist scholars in China.\n\n5. Ho-shang-kung’s and Wang Pi’s commentaries are typical examples.\n\n6. The idea of chùng-szu has been expressed in the Ma-Wang-Tui editions A and B as follows: “Let those who weigh death heavily have intent to move away.” If one is in accord with Tao, he should not be too concerned with the problem of life and death, but if he is, he should intentionally move away without delay. (See Chapter 80 under Appendix III.)\n\n7. For ch’ung-ssu in the sense of “die twice over” compare Lü Shih Ch’un Ch’iu, p. 131, end: “Everyone has to die once, but it may be truly said that Ch’ing Feng died twice over” (note in original).\n\n8.

The phrase “sageliness within and kingliness without” was traditionally considered to be a Confucian ethic, “sageliness within” referring to the development of inner qualities and “kingliness without” referring to the application of these qualities (helping others through government). Here Wang Pi reinterprets “sageliness within” as coming from Lao Tzu’s thought.\n\n14. For details, see the I Ching, p. 310.

Therefore, (the eternal) cannot be spoken of and named.\n\n2 All being originates from non-being. Therefore, while formless and unnamed, it is the beginning of all things. While formed and named, it grows, cultivates, protects, and disciplines, becoming the mother. Tao described as formless and unnamed begins the completion of all things. To begin and complete without knowing why—this is the mystery of the mystical.\n\nThe numbers designated in footnote form actually indicate Wang Pi’s commentary and may explain not only a particular term or the preceding sentence, but often all the preceding sentences as well. This translator’s comments will be noted with one or more asterisks and are placed after the commentary.\n\n3 Subtlety is infinitely small. All things originate from ultimate smallness and later achieve completion, begin from nothingness and then grow. Therefore constantly void of desire and empty, one may discern the mystery of the origin of things.\n\n4 Potentiality returns to the ultimate. All benefits of being must be based on the usefulness of non-being. Desire must be rooted in Tao in order to prevail. Therefore one constantly has desires in order to see the potential of ultimate things.\n\n5 “The two”* refer to the origin and the mother.** Coming from the same source means coming together from the mystic. Having different names, they function differently. In the beginning it is called the origin; at the end, it is called the mother. The mystic is dark, silent, and void; it is where the origin and the mother come from. It cannot be named, therefore it cannot be spoken of. Call it “the mystic,” because it is derived from the unobtainable, as it must be. If it must be so, then it cannot be determined by only one mystical element and to name it would be a big mistake. Therefore the mystic is more mystical than the most mystical. All subtle things come from this same source, which is therefore called the gate of all subtleties.\n\n* According to Ho-shang-kung, another famous commentator of the Lao Tzu, “the two” refers to having desire and not having desire. Wang Pi says they are “the origin” and “the mother.” But in actuality, “the two” should be interpreted as “being”s and “non-being” So according to a number of Chinese scholars, lines 5 through 8 of this text should be translated as follows:\n\nTherefore, constantly based on non-being,\n\nOne will have insight into its subtlety;\n\nConstantly based on being,\n\nOne will have insight into its potentiality.\n\n** In a comparison of the seven versions of the Tao Te Ching according to Wang Pi (Kondo, Okada, the Orthodox Tao-ts’ang, Ssu Pu Pei Yao or SPPY, Sun, T’ang, and Usami), the Kondo, Ssu Pu Pei Yao, and T’ang use the word “mother,” but the Okada, Orthodox Tao-ts’ang, Sun, and Usami use “nothingness.”"

The earth has its shape (poh ** but if it does not abide by heaven, it cannot possess complete tranquility. The heaven has the image of its spirit, but if it does not abide by Tao, it cannot preserve its spirit. When emptied and used, it is never exhausted. To fill it is to make it full; and when full, it will overflow. When emptied and used, it is never exhausted. So it is infinite to the utmost. Although its form is vast, it does not burden the body. Although its appearances are many, they do not fill its capacity. If all things forsake this to seek a master, where can the master be? Is this not deep enough to be the forefather of all things? Sharpness dulled but not destroyed; tangles sorted without labor; blending with the light without making the body unclean; becoming one with the dirt without giving up its innocence; is this not serene enough as if it hardly existed? The earth keeps its shape, and no virtue is beyond its support. The heaven enjoys its image, and no virtue is beyond its shelter; even heaven and earth cannot keep pace with it (Tao).

Without action or creation, all things rule each other by themselves. Therefore they are without kindness. Kindness creates, upholds, administers, and changes, with grace and action. Created, upheld, administered, and changed, things will lose their true nature. With grace and action, things cease to co-exist. If things cease to co-exist, then there is not enough to support them all. The earth does not grow straw for the beasts, but the beasts eat the straw. (The heaven) does not produce dogs for man, but man eats the dog.** Inaction in regard to all things means to let them do as they should. Then they will be self-sufficient. If one has to use wisdom, it will not work.\n\n2 The Sage, joining in the virtue of heaven and earth, compares the people to straw dogs.\n\n3 The bellows is a series of ranked bags; the stick is like a flute. A bellows holds emptiness, no passion, and inaction. Therefore, its emptiness is interminable. When moved, it is never exhausted. Between heaven and earth, everything abides by nature. So, like a bellows, it will never be exhausted.\n\n4 The more one does, the more he loses. Concerning the things, one reveals their ugliness. Concerning events, one says the wrong words. If one does not employ this, he does not know to pay attention to the amount exhausted.*** But keeping to the middle path like a bellows, he will never be exhausted. Denying oneself and letting things alone, everything will be in order. If a bellows intends to make its own sound, it cannot provide for those who request (sound).\n\n* A bellows is composed of a series of ranked bags with a stick through the middle.\n\n** Wang Pi separated the straw and the dog. But actually the two represent one thing, the straw dog. A straw dog is made of straws tied into a dog shape. People used it as a sacrifice during the worship ceremony. Afterwards, they would throw it away. Today, farmers still set up straw dogs in the fields to scare away birds during harvest time.\n\n*** The meanings here are obscure, so the translator has tried to interpret the words as accurately as possible."

Without shape or shadow, without rebellion or defiance, it lies low and motionless, keeps still and unfading, and thus forms the valley. It has no visible shape, yet it is ultimate. Lying low and unnamable, it is called the root of heaven and earth. Being interminable and seeming to endure, it can be used without toil. “The door” is the pathway of the mystic female. Following the pathway and uniting with the ultimate, it is therefore called the root of heaven and earth.

The soul is where man constantly resides. “One” means man’s true nature. This means a man can reside constantly in his house (soul), embracing the One with pure spirit, and never departing from it. Then all things will become but outsiders.\n\n2 To be intense means to let go; to induce means to reach the utmost. This means by letting go and breathing naturally, the harmony of the utmost suppleness can be achieved. By behaving like a baby without any desires, all things will be perfect and their nature will be obtained.\n\n3 The mystical is the ultimate of all things. It can wash away evil and disguise to achieve utmost vision. In not letting material things obscure the clarity and the flaw, is it not godlike? Then all is in accord with the mystical.\n\n4 To use art to achieve the end and to employ destiny to uncover the hidden things is wisdom. To discern the mystical vision clean and pure is to abandon sagacity. To govern the state without wisdom means to abandon wisdom. Can one do without wisdom? Then the people will not deviate and the state will be governed.\n\n5 The gate of heaven is where the world comes through. Opening and closing signify the moments of order and confusion. Opening or closing is the path of mandate to the world. Therefore it is called the opening and closing of the gate of heaven. The female responds but does not initiate, conforms but does not act. This means in the opening and closing of the gate of heaven, it is far better to assume the female’s part. Thus all things will pay respect and one’s residence is secure.\n\n6 It means that if one who is inactive can let his discernment reach the four corners without confusion or uncertainty, then all things will be transformed. This is to say Tao is constant inaction. If the duke and king can adhere to this, then all things will transform themselves.\n\n7 Not obstructing their sources, and not stifling their nature.\n\n8 Do not obstruct their sources; then things grow by themselves. So who can claim the credit? Do not stifle their nature; then things are self-sufficient. So who can assert action? Things grow fully by themselves without our control.

Profound virtue refers to having virtue without knowing its master; this comes from the mysterious world.\n\n* Ying poh (the same as hun poh represents two kinds of human souls.

At the time of the Chou dynasty (1125-255 B.C.), two further notes were added: Pien-chih F#) and Pien-kung B). Each note of this scale of five or seven notes can be used as a primary note, giving five or seven modes. As each of these five or seven modes can be transposed in twelve ways, there are sixty or eighty-four keys in Chinese music” (pp. 4–5).\n\n“It is the old scale of seven notes with the semitones between the fourth and fifth, identical in principle with the Curwen modulator of 1840. Further, there is extant the record of the work of Ssu-ma Ch’ien, who died in 85 B.C. He gave the length of the pitch-pipes for producing the five notes of the Chinese scale: Do (C), 81; Re (D), 72; Mi (E), 64; Sol (G), 54; La (A), 48.

Honor is necessarily accompanied by trouble. Fear and disgrace are equal. Honor and trouble are the same. When an “inferior” regards favor, disgrace, honor and trouble with fear, he will not cause disorder in the world.\n\n2 Great trouble is like honor and favor. Exerting too much for life, one must enter the territory of death. Therefore it is called great trouble. When a man deludes himself with honor and favor, the delusion is reflected in his body. This is the reason that great trouble is like one’s body.\n\n3 Because one possesses his body.\n\n4 When it returns to nature.\n\n5 Nothing can affect the body; this is to respect it. Then he can be entrusted with the world.\n\n6 Nothing can hurt the body; this is to “love” it. Then one can be lodged with the world. Not letting favor, disgrace, honor, and trouble hurt or change the body, one can be charged with the world.\n\n* The Okada and Sun versions of the Tao Te Ching completely omit the fourth line (“are likely to cause fear”).\n\n** The entire chapter including text and commentary advocates the doctrine of naturalism. One should not value oneself, nor highly respect one’s body, letting everything be natural and not letting favor and disgrace, honor and trouble startle the body and soul."

Although the present and Ancient are different, time has moved and customs have changed, still everything follows this principle to accomplish order.

Only this return can embrace and contain all things. If one loses this and moves on, then the perverse will enter and cause division. Then all things will disintegrate.

Therefore, learning is to improve one’s ability and increase one’s knowledge. If one is satisfied without desire, then why should one seek more? If one hits the target without knowledge, then why should one seek improvement? Swallows and sparrows are a match for each other; turtledoves and pigeons hate each other; folks in poor villages certainly know about wool and fur. To be natural is sufficient. To add more only results in sorrow. Therefore lengthening the legs of wild ducks is not different from shortening the necks of cranes. To advance for fear of one’s fame is not different from for fear of punishment. Between “yes” and “no” or “good” and “evil,” what makes the difference? Therefore, what the people fear I should fear too, but I cannot rely on it in applying myself.\n\n2 Sighing over one’s distance from the common people.\n\n3 The common people are obsessed with beauty and advancement and deluded by honor and profit.

Therefore, I alone prefer to be different from the people.\n\n* The Eighth Chapter of the Li Ki, shih mu ( (The nourishment from the Mother)) refers to the nursers; here it refers to the mother of all things (Tao).

Therefore it is said to be “formed in chaos.” It is not known whose son it was; therefore it existed before heaven and earth.\n\n2 “Silent and solitary” means it is formless and matchless, therefore standing alone. Returning and adapting, ending and starting, without losing its permanence; therefore it is unchanging.\n\n3 It can go around anywhere without peril and achieve the Great Shape. Therefore it may be the Mother of the world.\n\n4 The name determines the form; formed in chaos and shapeless, it cannot be determined. Therefore we do not know its name.\n\n5 The name determines the form, but the style states its merit. “Tao” means the way from which all things come. Formed in chaos, it can be described as the greatest.\n\n6 The reason I style it “Tao” is to show that among all things describable, it is the greatest. Regarding the source of this word, it is bound to the great. Anything great is bound to have divisions. Once it has divisions, it will lose its ultimate nature. Therefore, I name it great only with reluctance.\n\n7 “Out-going” means moving—not restricted to a great system, moves around and reaches everywhere. Therefore it is called “out-going.”\n\n8 “Far-reaching” means to reach the ultimate. Going around there is nowhere it cannot go, but it does not go in one direction only. Therefore it is called “far-reaching.” It doesn’t stay where it goes; its body* is free and therefore “returning.”\n\n9 In the nature of heaven and earth, man is valuable and the king is the chief of men. Therefore although his duty is not bound to the Great, he is also great. Matching the other three, the king therefore is also great.\n\n10 The four great things are Tao, heaven, earth, and king. All things that have names and titles are not ultimate realities. Tao has its own source. It is through this source that** it can be named “Tao.” The Tao which is the greatest of the namables is not as great as the Tao which is not namable. Unnamed, it cannot be obtained; therefore it is called the universe. Tao, heaven, earth, and the king are within the unnamed (universe). Therefore, there are four great things in the universe.\n\n11 The king is great because he is the master of men.\n\n12 “Abide by” means conform to the rule. Man does not violate the earth and thus achieves his security because he abides by the earth. The earth does not violate heaven and thus obtains its capacity to support because it abides by heaven. Heaven does not violate Tao and thus obtains its capacity to shelter because it abides by Tao. Tao does not violate its own nature and thus achieves its virtue because it abides by nature. Within the square, abide by the squareness; within the circle, abide by the roundness; never go against nature. Nature is an unnamed expression, the word for ultimate reality. To use wisdom is not as good as no wisdom. The shape is not as good as the image of the spirit; the image of the spirit is not as good as formlessness. Having principle is not as good as not having it. Therefore they abide by each other. Tao follows its natural way; thus heaven gets its assets. Heaven abides by Tao; therefore the earth gets its pattern. The earth abides by heaven; therefore the man gets its image. Therefore being their master to unite them together is the king.\n\n* Some versions use “will” (chih instead of “body” (ti Both “body” and “will” imply the exercising of freedom.\n\n** The Usami version of the Tao Te Ching omits “It is through this source that” but uses “therefore” instead."

These five explain that one should neither institute nor interfere, but follow the nature of things and not control them with forms.\n\n5 The Sage does not sort things by establishing norms. He does not favor the distinguished and forsake the defective by instituting directions. He helps things develop their nature without initiating. Thus no one is forsaken. Prefer not the worthy and able, so that the people will not fight; prize not the rare treasure, so that they will not steal; exhibit not the desirable, so that their hearts will not be distracted. Always keep people’s hearts from desires or distraction; then no one is forsaken.\n\n6 Uphold the good man for the bad man to emulate. Hence he is the teacher.\n\n7 “The material” means supply. The good man uses goodness to level badness, uses goodness to avert badness. Therefore the bad man is the material for the good man to take (work on).\n\n8 Although one has knowledge, employing one’s knowledge and not following the nature of things, he must lose Tao. Therefore, he is utterly lost in spite of his knowledge.\n\n* Never sacrifice mankind for the sake of Tao. To the contrary, this chapter emphasizes the practice of Tao in a wholesome society."

When true nature is dispersed, a hundred walks burst forth and different species, like vessels, spring to life.

Because its constancy is with namelessness, therefore Tao is constantly nameless. The unhewn wood is something with nothingness as its heart; it is also nameless. Therefore, if one wants to obtain Tao, there is no better way than to keep this simplicity. Then those who are wise can be led to serve competently; those who are brave can be directed to the military force; those who are skilled can be enlisted to work; and those with great strength can be made to carry heavy loads. The unhewn is something dull-witted, unbiased, and close to nothingness; therefore it cannot be subjugated. Embrace simplicity with inaction; never let the things disturb one’s true nature; never let desire harm one’s spirit; then all things will become guests by themselves and Tao will be attained by itself.\n\n2 That is to say: when heaven and earth conjugate, sweet dew will drop without being requested. I keep my true nature and do nothing; then the people, without being ordered, act fairly.\n\n3 The beginning of creation refers to the time when the unhewn essence was dispersed and chief officers were first appointed. First, the chief officers were given titles proper to their station to determine their rank. Therefore, in the beginning of creation, all were given names. From that time on, the people would fight for trivial points of a knife. Therefore, after names have been established, it is better to know the limits. If the name is allowed to master things, that is the mother of unruliness. Thus, knowing their limits will keep people free from danger.\n\n4 Brooks and valleys seek out rivers and seas; but the rivers and seas do not summon them. Without summons or search, the former return to the latter naturally. Therefore those who apply Tao to the world would make it self-regulated without ordering, and self-fulfilled without seeking. Therefore, they are as brooks and valleys are to rivers and seas.\n\n* The Orthodox Tao-ts’ang version of the Tao Te Ching omits this line.\n\n** All things will pay homage to dukes and kings by themselves.\n\n*** According to the Eighth Chapter of the Li Ki, p. 092: “Heaven and earth conjugate, then all things spring up.”"

To constantly gain without loss, and to have benefit without harmfulness, then it is called virtue. How is virtue gained? Through Tao. How is virtue fully completed? Through the use of non-being. Through the use of non-being, nothing is left unsupported. Therefore, if things rest in non-being, then everything is regulated; if they rest in being, then there is not enough to spare their lives. Therefore, although heaven and earth are vast, they use non-being as their heart; although the Sage is great, he regards emptiness as his master. That is to say: if one sees with Return,** he will discern the hearts of heaven and earth; if one meditates on the winter solstice,*** he can see the zenith of ancient kings. Therefore, if one subdues his selfishness and disregards his own body, then the Four Seas will pay him reverence, the far and the near will come to him. But if he distinguishes himself and becomes self-possessed, he cannot even preserve his own body, and his muscles and bones cannot tolerate each other.\n\nTherefore the man with the highest virtue uses Tao only. Not displaying his virtue, not grasping, not applying, thus he can have virtue, and nothing is left undone. To gain without seeking, to achieve without action, although he has virtue, he does not acquire the name of virtue.\n\nThe man with the lowest virtue gains by seeking, achieves by action, and establishes goodness to govern things. Thus he acquires the name of virtue. Gain by seeking cannot avoid loss; achievement by action cannot avoid failure. When the name “goodness” is produced, badness may respond. Therefore the man with the lowest virtue acts and has intent to act. Having no intent to act means employing without partiality. The man who cannot do anything through inaction has the lowest virtues, namely, human-heartedness, righteousness, propriety, and etiquette. In order to make clear the differences between the highest and the lowest virtues, the lowest virtue is compared with the highest virtue to the ultimate, measuring below the lowest virtue which is the highest benevolence.**** When one reaches the point with no intent to act, one still has to act. Therefore one should act with no specific intent, for to act intentionally is the calamity of action. The root lies in inaction; the mother rests in the nameless. To discard the root, to forsake the mother, and to follow the son, though the achievement may be great, it certainly does not help. Though the name may be splendid, falsehood will surely arise. If one is not able to achieve without action, to rule without initiation, and still has to act, then he must administer to all with human-heartedness and love.\n\nLoving without partiality, those with the highest human-heartedness therefore act with no intent to act. If love cannot be impartial, then curbing and resisting, rectifying and straightening will arise. Those with righteousness will detest the abuser and protect the righteous, helping this and attacking that. Everything, then, becomes intentional. Therefore, the man with the highest righteousness acts and has intent to act. To be right without moral devotion, then, those who like idle ornaments, elegant statements, and proper ceremonies would argue back and forth about the details, and disagreement between two opposing parties would arouse anger and grudges. Therefore those with the highest righteousness act, and if there is no response, they bare their arms to apply force.\n\nThe ultimate greatness is simply Tao! From this point on, nothing is worthy of respect! Therefore although those who have abundant virtue, plenty of property, and possession of all things can obtain their own virtue, they cannot achieve self-completion. Therefore, heaven cannot support; earth cannot shelter; man cannot be self-sufficient. Though all things***** are valuable, they must employ non-being and cannot cease to embody non-being. Not being able to cease to embody non-being, they cannot be great. That is to say when Tao is lost, virtue ensues. To use non-being is to have the Mother. Then, one does not toil, and everything is in order. Below this, when the mother is disused, and one has to act, then the best thing is to administer to all. If one cannot administer to all, then the best thing is to uphold the righteous. If one cannot uphold the righteous, then one venerates ornaments and ceremonies. Therefore, when virtue is lost, human-heartedness ensues; when human-heartedness is lost, righteousness ensues; when righteousness is lost, propriety ensues. Propriety begins with insufficient loyalty and honesty, the secretiveness of communication, the insistence on appearance, and fight for control of trivialities. When human-heartedness and propriety arise from within, practicing them can still be regarded as hypocrisy. How can those devoted to external ornaments last long? Therefore, propriety means the thinness of loyalty and honesty, and the beginning of disorder.\n\nForeknowledge means to know before others do; it is one of the lowest virtues. Exhaust one’s wisdom to claim foreknowledge; enslave one’s intelligence to manage mundane affairs; though his passion is worthwhile, he is full of wickedness and cunning; though his praise is profuse, he only loses more of his devotion and honesty! He labors only to make things confusing, manages only to cause government disruption. Even using his sagacity to the utmost, he does more damage to the people.\n\nForget oneself and let things alone; achieve peace without action; keep to simplicity and never follow laws and systems; let the people keep their gain and abandon what one has kept; recognize that the ornament of Tao is the beginning of ignorance. If one obtains the mother of achievement, then all things rise without his control; all things survive without his labor. Function without form and control without name; then human-heartedness and righteousness can be manifested; reverence can be manifested. Support with the great Tao, subdued with no name, then nothing is preferred and no intent is self-serving. Each carries his own purity and attends to events-with sincerity. Then, human-heartedness and virtue are thick; the use of righteousness is just; propriety and reverence are pure, To abandon that which supports, to forsake that which gives life, to employ one’s finished form, to enslave one’s intelligence, then human-heartedness becomes hypocritical,****** righteousness competitive, and propriety contentious. Therefore the depth of human-heartedness and virtue is not measured by the use of human-heartedness. The justice of employing righteousness is not accomplished by the use of righteousness. The purity of propriety and reverence is not achieved by the use of rituals only.\n\nTo support with Tao, to manage with the Mother, to distinguish without preference, to be made known without competing: use no name, then the name is true; use no shape, then the shape is formed. Keep the mother to preserve the son; honor the root to uphold the end. Then both the shape and name are there, and the wicked cannot thrive. Great righteousness matches heaven, and the ornament does not rise. Do not keep the mother at a distance; do not lose the root. Human-heartedness and righteousness are the issues of the Mother; they cannot be the mother’s model. Utensils are fashioned by the carpenter; they cannot be the carpenter. To forsake the mother and use the son; to abandon the root and follow the end; the names having their divisions and the shapes having their limits then though greatness is extended to the utmost, it must have not been completed; though goodness seems exuberant, there must be misfortune and sorrow. If achievement relies on action, it is not worth claiming.\n\n* The translation of this line is based on Fu’s Ancient Text of the Tao Te Ching in accord with Wang Pi’s commentary. Otherwise, it has to be translated as: “And has no intent to act.”\n\n** Return refers to the 24th hexagram of the I Ching, Fu (The Turning Point)). Refer to the I Ching, p. 98:\n\nThe idea of Return is based on the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially. Everything comes to itself at the appointed time. This is the meaning of heaven and earth.\n\n*** The winter solstice is the time of year when high governmental officials lock themselves up to rest (see the I Ching, p. 98):\n\nIn winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, the Arousing, is still underground. Movement is just at its beginning; therefore it must be strengthened by rest, so that it will not be dissipated by being used prematurely. This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing itself to be reinforced by rest, applies to all similar situations.\n\nWang Pi comments here that the present resembles the past, so movement is cyclical and natural.\n\n**** Some sinologists and my former professors suggest that this sentence should be:\n\nThe greatest capacity of the lowest virtue is the highest benevolence.\n\nBut I think the present translation is more in agreement with Lao Tzu’s degenerative order, from Tao to Te (virtue) to human-heartedness to righteousness to propriety.\n\n***** The SPPY and T’ang versions of the Tao Te Ching omit “they cannot achieve self-completion . . . Though all things.”\n\n****** Some versions have “hypocritical” (wei while others have “sincere” (ch’eng This translation uses the former based on the textual research of the Usami version."

Therefore, they are disrupted, exploded, dissolved, dissipated, perished, and fallen.\n\n2 Each with the One becomes clear, tranquil, divine, replete, alive and rectified.\n\n3 Use the One to obtain clarity, and not clarity to become clear. Keeping the One, then clarity won’t be lost; otherwise, clarity will probably bring disruption. So the mother of achievement cannot be forsaken. One does not make much of his achievement, for fear he will lose his roots.\n\n4 Clarity cannot become clear; fullness cannot become full. They all have their mother to keep their forms. Therefore clarity cannot be valued; fullness cannot be enough. The value lies in the mother, but the mother has no valued shape for distinction** so humility is used as its root; for the high uses the low as its foundation. Truly he who is most praiseworthy does not need praise. Jade or stone, beautiful or common, their substance is limited in their shape. So one doesn’t want them.\n\n* The translation of these two lines is based on the Orthodox Taots’ang version of the Tao Te Ching to correspond with Wang Pi’s commentary.\n\n** According to Professor Yen Ling-feng, this line should be:\n\nAnd the mother’s value has no shape,\n\nBecause the mother here resembles Tao."

Expansive but formless, it can never be filled.\n\n9 “Secret” means “to compete.” The sturdy virtue, following the natural course of things, doesn’t establish or employ. Therefore it appears “to compete (secretly).”\n\n10 Pure substance never boasts of its purity; therefore, it seems fluid.\n\n11 The square has never been cut; therefore, it has no corners.\n\n12 The great vessel completes the world without insisting on its own distinction, so it must be late in completing.\n\n13 Listened to, it cannot be heard; it is called soundless—its sound cannot be heard. Having sounds means having different divisions; being different, it is either kung or shang So different sounds cannot include all sounds. Therefore, any sound cannot be the great sound.\n\n14 Having shape means having divisions; when there are divisions, it will be either warm or hot, either hot or cold. Therefore a shaped image is not the great image.\n\n15 All those good things are completed by Tao. In terms of image, it is the great image. The great image does not have shape. In terms of sound, it is the great sound. The great sound sounds faint. Things are completed by it but they do not see its shape. Therefore it hides itself in namelessness. In rendering, it does not provide only for one’s needs; once rendered, its virtue lasts forever. Therefore, those who are good in rendering and completing things do not cut them as a carpenter does, so that nothing cannot adhere to its shape. Therefore this is called “good in completing.”"

Therefore regarding the birth of myriad things, I know their master (Tao). Though with myriad shapes, they blend breaths into one. People have their hearts, different states have different customs, but One is obtained so kings and dukes become their masters. With One as their master, how can it be forsaken? The more One multiplies, the further are the people from it: to be diminished is to be near the One; to be diminished to the utmost is to reach the ultimate. Though it has been called “One,” it adds up to three. Those whose roots are more than One, can they be close to Tao? “To diminish it in order to augment it.” Are these merely words?\n\n2 I do not force the people to follow me, but use nature to point out the true reason: following it will bring fortune, violating it will bring misfortune. Therefore the people teach each other that he who violates it will bring misfortune on himself, just as I teach the people not to violate it.\n\n3 The violent and the fierce cannot die a natural death. The people teach each other to be violent and fierce just as I teach them not to be violent and fierce, pointing out that the violent and the fierce cannot die a natural death. Teaching by these means, those who follow my teaching will be fortunate. Therefore I can obtain those who reject other teachings, and then I become the father of teaching.\n\n* The translator has followed Wang Pi’s commentary in interpreting this line.

Thus even if the silk string cap covers the eyes, he is not afraid of being cheated; even if the yellow cap covers his ears, he is not worried about being slighted.**** Then why should he belabor intelligence to examine the feelings of the people? If one examines things with intelligence, all things will use their intelligence in response. If one examines things with distrust, all things will strive to respond with mistrust. The hearts of the world are not the same, but their responses dare not be different. Then they will not make use of their feelings. The greatest damage is no more damaging than the use of intelligence: emphasize shrewdness, and the people will sue; emphasize force, and the people will fight. One does not surpass others in shrewdness; when brought to court, he will be in distress. One does not surpass others in strength; on the battleground, he will be in danger. If one cannot prevent the people from using shrewdness and force against him, then he is one against many, while the people are many against him, then he increases the dragnets of law, multiplies the forms of punishment, blocks the pathways, and attacks private homes, then all things will lose their natural virtue. People will forsake their brothers; birds will be disturbed above; fish will be disoriented below. Therefore the Sage draws back from the world. With no fixed ideas in his heart, he tries to harmonize the hearts of the world. With no specific intent or direction, he does not discriminate; so why should the people avoid him? He has no requests, so how can the people react? Neither avoiding nor reacting, the people will use their natural feelings. A man should not forsake what he can do and do what he cannot do; forsake his strengths and engage his weakness. Then he who talks will tell what he knows, and he who performs will do what he can. Therefore the people will lend their ears and eyes, and I (the Sage) will regard them all as infants.\n\n* The SPPY version of the Tao Te Ching omits this line.\n\n** According to Kao Heng this line should be translated: “And the Sage closes them.”\n\n*** Refer to the I Ching, p. 354:\n\nHeaven and earth determine the places.

People who live by overnourishing themselves have no grounds for life. Those who know how to sustain life do not take life too seriously; therefore, they have no grounds for death. The most harmful instruments are weapons and the most harmful beast is no more than a rhinoceros or tiger; if one is able to keep weapons from lodging their blades and points and rhinoceros and tigers from applying their claws and horns, then his body is not burdened (by desires). Then where are his grounds for death? The earthworms regard the depths of a river as shallow and dig a hole in it; the powerful eagles regard the mountain as low and build a nest on top; where harpoons and bird-shooting devices cannot reach, there are no grounds for death. But they are eventually lured by sweet bait, and enter a place without life; is this not called over-nourishing one’s life? Therefore if things (people) are not driven by their desires and move far away from their roots, if they are not driven by desires and submerge their true nature, then entering battle, they will never be hurt, and traveling on land, they will never be attacked.

With inaction, one can win the world. A former chapter* indicates that one always wins the world with inaction. If one has to act, one is not good enough to win the world. Therefore governing a nation with rectitude, one is not good enough to win the world and has to use brilliant strategies in battles. Governing a nation with Tao, one honors the roots and eases the branches; governing a nation with rectitude, one establishes laws to attack the branches. When the roots are not established, the branches are sparse, the people cannot subsist; therefore, one has to use the army with brilliant strategies.\n\n2 Sharp weapons refer to all instruments which can be for selfish purposes. When the people are strong, the nation becomes weak.\n\n3 If the people are full of intelligence, then cleverness and hypocrisy will flourish; when cleverness and hypocrisy flourish, wickedness prevails.\n\n4 To establish rectitude to stop wickedness, one must employ military trickery. Multiply taboos and prohibitions to ward off poverty, but the people become increasingly poor. Use sharp weapons to strengthen the nation, but the nation becomes more chaotic. All of this is caused by forsaking the roots and managing the branches.\n\n5 What the higher people desire, the common people would quickly follow; if I desire only to be without desire, then the people would have no desires and become simple.

      "content": "APPENDIX I\n\nTHE COLLECTIVE BIOGRAPHY OF LAO TZU1\n\nby\n\nSsu-ma Ch’ien\n\nLao Tzu was born in Ch’ü-jen village, Li district, K’u county, in the state of Ch’u. He was surnamed Li, named Erh, styled Poyang, and posthumously titled Tan. He was the keeper of the archives of Chou.\n\nWhen Confucius went to Chou to ask him about the meaning of propriety, Lao Tzu responded, “The men whom you talked about and their bones have already rotted. Only their words remain. What is more, when a gentleman is in keeping with the times, he rides the chariot; when he is not, he drifts with the wind. I have heard that a good merchant secretly hides his goods and appears to possess nothing, and that a gentleman of great virtue assumes the appearance of ignorance. Abandon your arrogance, multiple desires, pretentious affectation and excessive ambition. They are of no benefit to you. This is all I have to tell you.”\n\nConfucius left and said to his disciples, “I know that birds can fly, fish can swim, and animals can run. Whatever runs can be trapped with nets; whatever swims can be caught with fishing lines; whatever flies can be shot with arrows. But as for dragons, I do not know how they ride the wind and clouds and soar in the sky. Today I saw Lao Tzu. Is he not like a dragon?”2\n\nWhen Lao Tzu cultivated himself with Tao and Te, he became concerned with self-effacement and anonymity. He lived in Chou for a long time, but he saw that Chou was on the decline, so he left. When he reached the Pass,3 the keeper, Kuan Yin, greeted him with delight:4 “Since you are going to retire, could you make an effort to write something for me?” Consequently, Lao Tzu wrote a book with two parts which discussed the meaning of Tao and Te in a little over five thousand words and then departed. No one knows what happened to him since.\n\nSome say, “Lao Lai Tzu, likewise from Ch’u, wrote fifteen chapters to discuss the applications of Taoism and was a contemporary of Confucius.” The reason was that Lao Tzu lived to be over 160 years old (some say over 200 years old) because he cultivated Tao and consequently nurtured longevity.\n\nOne hundred twenty-nine years after Confucius died, according to the Historical Records, the great Chou historian Tan came to see Duke Hsien (362-338 B.C.) of Ch’in and told him, “In the beginning, the states of Ch’in and Chou were united and then separated. They were separated for five hundred years and then reunited. They have been reunited for seventy years,5 and a powerful king6 will be born.” Some say that Tan was Lao Tzu. Others say that he was not. No one knows which is true.\n\nLao Tzu was a hermit. His son was named Tsung. Tsung was a general of the state of Wei and was given the fief of Tuan Kan. Tsung’s son was Chu, Chu’s son was Kung, and Kung’s great-great-grandson was Chia. Chia was an official under King Hsiao Wen (202-157 B.C.) of the Han dynasty. And Chia’s son, Chieh, was the royal tutor of Prince Ang of Chiao Hsi. Therefore, he made his home in Ch’i.\n\nThe people who study Lao Tzu tend to disparage Confucianism, and those who study Confucianism also disparage Lao Tzu. Does this not illustrate that people who do not follow the same Tao have nothing to do with each other? Li Erh’s philosophy is that inaction brings self-transformation, quietude brings rectification.\n\nNOTES TO APPENDIX I\n\n1. “The Collective Biography of Lao Tzu” is taken from “The Collective Biographies of Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu (?369-286 B.C.), Shen Pu-hai (d. 337 B.C.), and Han Fei Tzu (?280-233 B.C.),” pp. 677–678, in the Historical Records by Ssu-ma Ch’ien (145-86 B.C.). “Collective” means a collection of the significant acts or deeds in their lives for the people to pass on to the generation. Lao Tzu was believed to have lived in either (?604-531 B.C.) or (561-467 B.C.).\n\n2. This story also appears in the Chuang Tzu, Chapter 14, “The Turning of Heaven.”\n\n3. The Pass refers either to Han Ku Kuan now in Honan Province, or San Kuan now in Shensi Province.\n\n4. A number of Chinese scholars interpret “the keeper of the pass, Kuan Yin-hsi, said . . . “ instead of “the keeper, Kuan Yin, greeted him with delight . . . . “ Hsi in Chinese means “delight” on the one hand and can be taken as part of the proper name of the keeper on the other. The ambiguity is caused by the lack of punctuation or any sign of a proper name (comparable to capitalization in English) in ancient Chinese.\n\n5. More accurately the two states had been reunited for “seventeen years” rather than “seventy years.” See Kao Heng, A Revised Collation of the Lao Tzu, pp. 177–178.\n\n6. The “king” refers to Ying Cheng, who launched a war for conquering Han, Chao, Yen, Wei, Ch’u, and Ch’i, and completed the unification of China between 230 and 221 B.C. He gave himself the title Ch’in Shih Huang (The First Emperor of Ch’in) or Shih Huang Ti (The First Emperor (of China)) (259-201 B.C.). Thus, the Warring States period came to an end."

      "title": "Appendix II: The Biography of Wang Pi",
      "content": "APPENDIX II\n\nTHE BIOGRAPHY OF WANG PI1\n\nby\n\nHo Shao\n\nWang Pi of Shan-yang liked to discuss Confucianism and Taoism. He was talented in writing and superlative in argumentation. He wrote commentaries on the I Ching and Lao Tzu, became the sub-secretary of the Royal Secretariat (shang shu lang), and died in his early twenties. Pi was styled Fu-szu. Ho Shao wrote his biography as follows;2 As a child, Pi showed great intelligence. In his teens, he liked Lao Tzu and exhibited understanding, discrimination, and eloquence. His father, Yeh, was also the sub-secretary of the Royal Secretariat. P’ei Fei was then the sub-secretary of the Civil Personnel Department (li pu lang). Pi, only a young adult, visited him. Fei was immediately amazed and asked Pi, “Non-being is truly the source of all things, but the Sage is not willing to discuss it. Why does Lao Tzu expound on it constantly?” Pi replied, “The Sage embodies non-being, and non-being cannot be taught; hence he does not discuss it. Lao Tzu is for being and constantly discusses its insufficiency.”3 Soon Pi also became acquainted with Fu Ku (209–255). At the time, Ho Yen (190–249), the secretary of the Civil Personnel Department (li pu shang shu), thought Pi was extraordinary and exclaimed, “Chung-ni (Confucius) says that the young are awe-inspiring. Is this not the man with whom you can discuss the rapport between heaven and man?” During the period of Cheng Shih (240–249), the position of the Palace Chief of Staff (huang men shih lang) was repeatedly vacant. After Chia Ch’ung (217–282), P’ei Hsiu (224–271), and Chu Cheng, Yen now considered appointing Pi. But at that time, Ting Pi, who was vying with Yen for power, introduced Wang Li of Kao-i to Ts’ao Shuang (178–249). Shuang appointed Li, and Pi was appointed to fill the office of the sub-secretary of the Royal Secretariat (t’ai lang). When Pi assumed office, he visited Shuang and asked for a private audience. Shuang dismissed his attendants and discussed Tao with Pi. As time passed, Pi discussed nothing but Tao, and Shuang laughed at him. Shuang was then in control of the government. Those who followed and agreed with him got promoted. Pi was aloof, distinguished, indifferent, and in great repute. When Li became sick and died soon after, Shuang appointed Wang Shen to replace Li, and Pi lost his chance to serve under Shuang. Yen was disgusted and chagrined. In Pi’s tenure as the sub-secretary of the Royal Secretariat, since he was not skillful in general management, he did not take the job seriously. Liu T’ao of Huai-nan discussed diplomacy (tsung heng)4 knowledgeably and was considered an expert by his contemporaries. Whenever he talked with Pi, he often won the argument, but Pi’s distinguished talent was such that whenever he had a point, no one could gainsay him. By nature Pi was rational and amiable, and he enjoyed outings and feasts. He was good in music and tou hou (a Chinese game).5 When he discussed Tao and engaged in writings, his diction was not as good as Yen’s but his innate ability far surpassed Yen’s. He tended to show off his specialty and scorned people, thus frequently incurring the disgust of other gentlemen. Pi and Chung Hui (225–264) were good friends. Hui loved arguments and was an expert on the investigations of name-principles, but he always bowed to Pi’s highmindedness.\n\nHo Yen felt that the Sage was a person without joy, anger, sorrow, or delight. His argument was very subtle, and Chung Hui and others expounded on it, but Pi took issue with them. He felt that the Sage was richer than ordinary people in insight, and the same as ordinary people in the five passions.6 Being richer in insight, he is able to experience harmony in communicating with non-being. Having the same five passions as others, he is not lacking in sorrow or delight and is responsive to things. Hence by nature the Sage can respond to things without being burdened by them, and to say that the absence of burden means a lack of responsiveness misses by a long shot. Pi wrote a commentary on the I Ching, and Hsün Jung of Ying Ch’uan refuted his interpretation of the “Great Expansion” (tai-yen).7 Pi responded in a sarcastic letter saying “Discernment can fathom the subtle and profound, but it cannot negate the essence of nature. Yen Tzu’s capacity was already known by Master Confucius. But when they met, Confucius could not help but feel happy, and when (Yen Tzu) died, he could not help but feel sad.8 We often criticized him for not making his emotions conform to his principles, but now we know that human nature cannot be changed. Your capacity is already bound by your chest and stomach. Why, then, for the last ten or fifteen days have you been so excessively concerned about me? So if we understand the relation between Master Ni (Confucius) and Yen Tzu, then we can avoid making a big mistake.”\n\nPi’s commentary on the Lao Tzu provides a concise guide, with systematic arrangement which illumines Tao in terse statements.9 His commentary on the I Ching frequently has excellent statements. Wang Chi of T’ai Yüan, who loved to expostulate but disliked Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, often said that after he had read Pi’s commentary on the I Ching, he comprehended a great deal more. However, Pi’s personality was shallow, and he did not understand the nature of things. At first, he was on good terms with Wang Li and Hsün Jung, but he held a grudge against Li when Li captured the position of the Palace Chief of Staff from him. His relations with Jung did not last long either. In the tenth year of Cheng Shih, Ts’ao Shuang was removed from office,10 but (Pi) was spared because he was not officially involved. That fall, Pi became seriously ill and died without an heir at the age of twenty-four. The Duke of Chin heard about Pi’s death and grieved for days. It was such a severe loss to the highest intelligentsia! According to Sun Sheng,11 the I Ching is a book which penetrates the mystic and discerns the principles of change. Unless a person is endowed with the best in the world, how can he have anything to do with it? Therefore, all of the connotators of the world have been mistaken. In particular, how can Wang Pi use his twisted arguments to generalize on the profound meaning of the mystic? Thus he uses an abundance of ornate expressions to explicate his superficial meanings and a clever, flawless obtrusiveness to establish the yin and the yang; but the Six Mixes affecting the change of myriad things and the cycle of days, months, years, and time and the interactions of the five atmospheres have not been his concern. Therefore, although he has his definite contribution, he is probably far from the great Tao. The Record of the Archives (po wu chi) says that at first, Wang Ts’an (177–217) and his cousin K’ai both retreated to Ching Chou. Liu Piao (144–208)12 wanted to marry his daughter to Ts’an but rejected him because of his homely appearance and rash behavior. Feeling that K’ai was graceful, he married his daughter to K’ai.13 K’ai begot Yeh; Yeh was Liu Piao’s grandson. Ts’ai Yung14 had nearly 10, 000 volumes of books, and in his old age, he sent several cartloads to Ts’an. After Ts’an died, Assistant Premier (hsiang Kuo tsu) Wei Feng plotted a revolt. Ts’an’s sons were involved and therefore executed. Yung’s books were then passed on to Yeh.15 Yeh, styled Chang-hsü, reached the position of the Chief Protocol Officer (yeh che p’u she). His son, Hsüan, styled Cheng-tsung, held the position of the Police Head of the Imperial Capital (szu li chiao wei). Hung was Pi’s older brother. According to The Wei’s Spring and Autumn, after Emperor Wen16 executed Ts’an’s two sons he made Yeh the heir of Ts’an.\n\nNOTES TO APPENDIX II\n\n1. “The Biography of Wang Pi (226–249)” by Ho Shao (236–301) appears as one of the commentaries to “The Biography of Chung Hui (225–264)” written by Ch’en Shou (233–297) in his “Record of the Wei dynasty” in The Record of the Three Kingdoms (Shu (221–264), Wei (220–265), and Wu (222–280)).\n\n2. The preceding lines were stated by Ch’en Shou.\n\n3. This explains what Lao Tzu expressed in Chapter 56: “The one who knows does not speak; the one who speaks does not know,” and in Chapter 81: “One who knows does not know all; one who knows all does not know at all.” It shows at least that when he was less than twenty years old, Wang followed the fashion of his time in preferring the Sage (Confucius) to Lao Tzu.\n\n4. During the age of the Warring States, these were two opposing principles in diplomacy: a confederacy against Ch’in uniting the states vertically (tsung) and a federation under Ch’in uniting the states horizontally (heng). Thus people refer to the tactics of diplomacy as the vertical and horizontal, or tsung heng.\n\n5. Tou hu A game played during feasts in which the one who got the greatest number of arrows into a distant pot became the winner. Chapter 19 of the Li Ki, no. 40, titled “Tou Hu,” has a full description of the game.\n\n6. The five passions are joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure and love; sometimes, hate and desire are added to become seven passions.\n\n7. According to the I Ching, p. 310, the number of the Great Expansion is 50. However, only 49 are used. The sum of the odd numbers and the even numbers from one to ten (1+3+5+7+9=25, 2+4+6+8+10=30) is 55. (See Fung’s A History of Chinese Philosophy, 2:181–182.) From these 55, subtract 5 which represent the five basic elements of the universe (metal, wood, water, fire, and earth). Through the remaining 50, all things in the world can transform into and communicate with each other. Of the 50, the number One is unique because it represents Tao—the great ultimate. Hence only 49 are used. The scholars before Wang Pi’s time regarded the numbers cosmologically as follows: Each number is both a symbol and a number. The number or symbol existed before the creation of all things and will remain after the destruction of all things. Therefore, the relationship between the substance and the function is that of the One (1) and the Many (49), which belong to two distinctive categories. But Wang Pi interpreted this relationship as follows:\n\nTo employ the numbers of Heaven and Earth, rely on 50, but use only 49. One is not used; being unused, all usefulness can flow from it. It is not a number (like other numbers), but all numbers are completed by it. This is the ultimate of change. These 49 numbers are the ultimate of numbers because non-being cannot manifest itself from non-being; it must rely on being (the 49 numbers). Besides, the ultimate of things (49) must be manifested from their source (the One). (See The Ancient Commentaries on the Five Classics, pp. 048–049.)\n\nThat is to say, Wang Pi introduced the Taoist concept into the I Ching. His argument, philosophically, is that the substance and the function should be one. The function should arise from the substance; without the substance, there is no function. The substance exists only through its function; without function, there is no substance. This metaphysical idea can be applied to the relationship between One and Many. One and Many, substance and function, must be one. In his letter to Hsün Jung, Wang Pi explained the relationship of the Sage’s (Confucius’) emotion and his reason as that of substance and function, which should not be separated because they are one.\n\n8. Yen Hui (521-490 B.C.) was one of the most outstanding disciples of Confucius. When he died, Confucius said, “Alas! Heaven has destroyed me! Heaven has destroyed me!” (See The Analects, Book 11, “Hsien Chin,” Chapter 8.)\n\n9. Other than his commentary on the Lao Tzu, Wang Pi’s works on Taoism were believed to have been lost. Professor Yen Lingfeng, however, stated recently that he had found Wang Pi’s Some Examples of the Implicit Meanings of Lao Tzu in The Collection of the Orthodox Tao-ts’ang (Taoist Canon). Based on the Ming dynasty edition of the collection, he photolithographed it for inclusion in his first series of The Collected Works on the Lao-tzu.\n\n10. Ts’ao Shuang was killed in that year by Ssu-ma I (178–251), a famous general of the Later Han dynasty.\n\n11. Sun Sheng (fourth century) was a native of Chung-tu in T’ai Yuan. He was a man with broad knowledge and great discernment. (See Wang’s New Interpretations of Popular Sayings, Part 1 of Book 1, p. 27.) His two books of history, The Wei’s Spring and Autumn (Wei shih ch’un ch’iu) and particularly The Chin Yang (Spring) and Autumn (Chin yang ch’iu), won him the title of the Distinguished Historian (liang shih). In his public life, he served under several famous generals, T’ao K’an (259–334), Yu Liang (289–340) and Huan Wen (312–373). His last official position was the Supervising Censor (mi shu chien) and he died at the age of seventy-two.\n\n12. Liu Piao (144–208) of Kao-ping, Shanyang, had a distant kinship with the Imperial House of Han. In 190 he was appointed governor of Ching Chou which he made famous as a center of learning. Scholars such as Soong Chung, Wang Ts’an, etc., got together and launched a new movement in the intensive study of Taoism and the application of its concepts in the interpretation of the meanings of classical writings.

      "content": "APPENDIX III\n\nTHE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WANG PI’S EDITION AND THE MA-WANG-TUI EDITIONS A AND B\n\nThe significance of the recent discovery of two lost editions of the Tao Te Ching at Ma-Wang-Tui has yet to be studied. Some of the groundwork for such a study, however, is presented here in a comparison of the major differences between Wang Pi’s edition and the Ma-Wang-Tui editions. For Wang Pi’s edition of the Tao Te Ching, I used the Okada version with references to other versions when relevant. In addition, the ancient Fu version is included in the comparison since it is one of the oldest and most significant versions of Lao Tzu’s work.\n\nIn General\n\nThe Ma-Wang-Tui editions differ from modern versions in chapter order. Chapter 24 in modern versions comes before chapter 22 in both MWT editions. Modern chapter 41 is “chapter” 40 in MWT edition B, but seems to have been omitted in edition A. Finally, modern chapters 80 and 81 are “chapters” 67 and 68 in the MWT editions A and B.\n\nChapter 1\n\nlines 5–8 “Therefore constantly without desire, There is the recognition of subtlety; But constantly with desire, Only the realization of potentiality.” The MWT editions A and B agree with this translation’s punctuation because at the ends of lines 5 and 7, both editions have a function word yeh to indicate a “stop.”\n\nChapter 2\n\nline 7 “long and short shape each other” The Fu and MWT editions agree with the above translation, but the Ssu Pu Pei Yao version reads: “long and short compare with each other” line 9 “sound and voice harmonize with each other” The MWT edition A reads: “meaning and voice correspond with each other” (After line 10 (“front and back follow each other”), both MWT editions A and B have the two words heng yeh which mean “constantly so.”) line 13 “He lets all things rise without dominating them” Both MWT editions A and B and the Fu edition read: “He lets all things rise without initiating them”\n\nChapter 3\n\nline 6 “so that their hearts will not be distracted” The MWT editions read: “so that they will not be distracted”\n\nChapter 5\n\nline 8 “Too much talk often brings exhaustion.” Both MWT editions A and B read: “Too much hearing often brings exhaustion.”\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nline 5 “Fill a hall with gold and jade” The Fu edition agrees with the above translation, but the MWT editions A and B interpret the line as follows: “Fill a house with gold and jade” lines 9–10 “He who withdraws after achieving success and performing duty” The MWT editions A and B interpret this line as follows: “He who achieves success and withdraws”\n\nChapter 10\n\nline 5 “The mystic vision being pure and clear” In the MWT editions A and B, “the mystic vision” is simply one’s “inner mirror” or “insight.”\n\nlines 7–8 “Loving the people and governing the state, Can man be without action?” In the Fu and MWT editions, the above lines are rendered as follows: “Loving the people and governing the state, Can man not use knowledge?”\n\nChapter 12\n\nThe following is a comparison of the order of the first five lines of this translation and of the MWT editions:\n\nPresent Line Order MWT Line Order 1 1 2 5 3 4 4 2 5 3\n\nChapter 13\n\nline 15 “can be lodged with it” The Fu and MWT editions read: “can be entrusted with it” line 17 “can be entrusted with it” The Fu and MWT editions read: “can be lodged with it”\n\nChapter 14\n\nline 2 “it is called colorless” The MWT editions A and B read: “it is called formless”\n\nline 6 “it is called formless” The MWT editions A and B read: “it is called colorless” lines 16–17 “confronting it, one cannot see the head; following it, one cannot see the back.” The MWT editions A and B reverse the order of these lines: “following it, one cannot see the back; confronting it, one cannot see the head.” line 18 “Grasp the Ancient Tao . . . “ According to the MWT editions A and B this phrase should be: “Grasp the Modern Tao . . . “\n\nChapter 15\n\nline 1 “The Ancients who made themselves the best” The Fu and MWT editions read: “The Ancients who were good with Tao” line 17 “he can be sheltered and beyond renewal” The Fu and MWT editions read: “he can endure wearing out and is beyond completion”\n\nChapter 18\n\nThe third word of the last line, “There are loyal ministers,” is ch’eng meaning virtuous, instead of chung meaning loyal, in the Fu and MWT editions.\n\nChapter 21\n\nline 8 “From ancient times until now” is expressed in the MWT editions A and B as “from the present time to the ancient.” The MWT editions infer that Taoism is a modern concept being applied to ancient times and some sinologists feel that this is closer to fact. line 10 “By this the beginning of all things is known.” The fourth word “beginning” in the MWT editions A and B is “father.” So is the sixth word of line 11, “How can I know the beginning of all things?”\n\nChapter 22\n\n\n\nChapter 23\n\nline 11 “If one resembles Tao, Tao is pleased to accept him.” This line is omitted in the MWT editions A and B. lines 12–13 “If one resembles virtue, virtue is pleased to accept him. If one resembles loss, loss is also pleased to accept him.” The MWT editions render these lines as follows: “If one resembles virtue, Tao also values him. If one resembles loss, Tao also loses him.”\n\nChapter 24\n\nline 2 “Those who stride cannot walk.” The MWT editions A and B omit this line. lines 3–6 “Those who hold to their views cannot be enlightened. Those who are self-righteous cannot shine.” The MWT editions A and B read as follows: “Those who show themselves cannot become famous. Those who look at themselves cannot be luminous.” line 14 “So those with Tao do not want to stay with them.” The MWT editions render this line as follows: “So (even) those with desire do not want to take up residence.”\n\nChapter 25\n\nline 4 “It goes around without peril.” The MWT editions A and B omit this line.\n\nChapter 26\n\nline 3 “Therefore the Sage . . . “ “The Sage” is “the gentleman” in both MWT editions and the Fu edition.\n\nChapter 28\n\nBetween lines 5 and 6, the MWT editions A and B also include the following five lines:\n\n“Knowing the white and keeping the black,\n\nOne will become the valley of the world.\n\nBeing the valley of the world,\n\nOne has enough constant virtue\n\nand can return to simplicity.”\n\nChapter 29\n\nThe order of the last line in the MWT editions A and B is:\n\n“the excessive, the extreme, and the extravagant”\n\nChapter 30\n\nline 6 “After a great war comes the year of adversity.” The MWT editions A and B omit this line.\n\nChapter 31\n\nThe MWT editions A and B omit the first word of the first line,\n\n“Fine,” and lines 6 and 7 are rendered as follows:\n\n“Weapons are not the tools of the gentleman;\n\nThey are the tools of evil.”\n\nChapter 33\n\nline 8 “To die without extinction means longevity.” The MWT editions A and B read: “To die without (being) forgotten means longevity.”\n\nChapter 34\n\nlines 3–4 “All things rely on it for life, But it does not dominate them.” The MWT editions A and B omit these two lines and render lines 5 through 9 as follows:\n\n“Achieving success and completing the tasks (for all things), It does not want to be their master. All things return to it, but it does not want to be their master; Constantly void of desire, it can be called small.” lines 13–14 “Just because the Sage would never regard himself as great, He is able to attain his own greatness.” In the MWT editions, these two lines are as follows: “Therefore, the Sage can become great, Because he has never regarded himself as great; So he can attain his own greatness.”\n\nChapter 35\n\nline 6 “But Tao spoken by mouth is flavorless and bland.” In the Fu and MWT editions, this line reads: “What Tao says is flavorless and bland.”\n\nChapter 36\n\nlines 6–7 “The soft overcomes the hard; The weak overcomes the strong.” The Fu edition agrees with this translation. The Ssu Pu Pei Yao edition reads: “The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.” The MWT editions A and B read: “The soft and weak overcome the strong.”\n\nChapter 37\n\nline 2 “But it leaves nothing undone.” The MWT editions A and B omit this line.\n\nline 9 “The world will keep peace by itself” meaning peace, is cheng meaning justice, in the Fu and MWT editions.\n\nChapter 38\n\nlines 9–10 “He with the lowest virtue acts And has intent to act.” The Fu edition reads: “He with the lowest virtue acts And has no intent to act.” Both the MWT editions A and B omit these two lines. line 25 “And the beginning of ignorance” The MWT edition A reads: “And the capital of ignorance” The MWT edition B reads: “And the capital of disorder”\n\nChapter 39\n\nline 6 “All things obtained the One for their lives” The MWT editions A and B omit this line. lines 28–29 “He who is most praiseworthy Does not need any praise.” In the Okada, Ssu Pu Pei Yao, and MWT editions A and B, these two lines are rendered: “Therefore a carriage separated into parts cannot be a carriage.”\n\nChapter 40\n\nline 3 “All things in the world are produced by being.”\n\nIn the MWT editions, this line is:\n\n“Things of the world are produced by being.”\n\nChapter 41\n\n\n\nChapter 42\n\n\n\nChapter 43\n\nlines 3–4 “Things without substance can penetrate things without crevices.” The MWT edition A agrees with this translation, but the MWT edition B and Fu edition read: “Things which come from nothingness penetrate things without crevices.”\n\nChapter 49\n\nThe MWT editions A and B delete all use of the pronoun “I.”\n\nChapter 51\n\n\n\nChapter 52\n\nline 17 “This is called practicing the constant” The Fu and MWT editions A and B read: “This is called inheriting the constant”\n\nChapter 55\n\nlines 4–5 “Ferocious beasts will not seize; Predatory birds will not pounce” The MWT edition A reads: “Predatory birds and ferocious beasts will not pounce” But the MWT edition B reads: “Predatory birds and ferocious beasts will not seize” line 9 “The organ is fully formed” The MWT editions A and B read: “The organ is furiously active”\n\nChapter 57\n\nThe last line (“I have no desire s . . . “) reads in the MWT editions A and B: “I desire no desires . . . “\n\nChapter 58\n\nline 5 “Calamity is what good fortune depends on.” In the MWT edition B, this line is omitted. line 12 “Therefore, the Sage is square but not cutting” In the MWT editions A and B, the second and third words “the Sage” are omitted.\n\nChapter 59\n\nline 3 “Only through thriftiness can one submit (to Tao) early” The Fu and MWT editions A and B read: “Only thriftiness brings an early submission”\n\nChapter 60\n\nline 7 “But the Sage will not hurt them either’’ The MWT editions A and B read: “But the Sage will not hurt either”\n\nChapter 61\n\nlines 2–3 “It is the focus point of the world And the female of the world.” The order of these two lines is reversed in the MWT editions A and B. “It is the female of the world And the focus point of the world.”\n\nChapter 62\n\nline 1 “Tao is the refuge of all things” The MWT editions A and B read: “Tao is where all things pour in” line 7 “and the three dukes are installed” The MWT editions A and B read: “and the three ministers are installed”\n\nChapter 64\n\nline 3 “Fragile things are easy to shatter.” The Fu and MWT editions A and B read: “Fragile things are easy to tell apart.” line 9 “A nine-story terrace begins with a heap of earth.” The MWT editions A and B read:\n\n“A nine-tenths completed terrace begins with a heap of earth.” line 10 “A thousand-li journey starts from beneath one’s feet.” The MWT edition A renders this line as follows: “A hundred jen eight feet = one jen) height starts from beneath one’s feet.” While the MWT edition B reads: “A height of a hundred thousand starts from beneath one’s feet.”\n\nChapter 65\n\nline 1 “The Ancients who were good in practicing Tao” The MWT edition A reads: “It has been said that those who practiced Tao” And the MWT edition B reads: “The Ancients who practiced Tao” lines 5–8 “Therefore, one who rules the nation with knowledge robs the nation. One who does not rule the nation with knowledge brings good fortune to the nation.” The MWT edition A reads: “Therefore, one who makes the country known with knowledge robs the country. One who does not know how to make the country known brings virtue to the country.” The MWT edition B reads: “Therefore, one who makes the nation known with knowledge robs the nation. One who does not know how to make the nation known brings virtue to the nation.”\n\nChapter 66\n\nlines 8–9 “Therefore, the Sage stays above and the people do not feel the burden. He stays in front and the people do not consider him harmful.” The MWT edition A reads: “Therefore, (one) stays in front and the people do not consider him harmful. He stays above and the people do not feel the burden.” And the MWT edition B reads: “Therefore, (one) stays above and the people do not feel the burden. He stays in front and the people do not consider him harmful.”\n\nChapter 67\n\nlines 5–6 “I have three treasures To be kept and treasured” The MWT edition A reads: “I constantly have three treasures” The MWT edition B reads: “I constantly have three treasures To be kept and treasured” line 14 “One can be the master of the vessels” The MWT edition A reads: “One can be the master of the affairs” The MWT edition B reads: “One can be the master of the vessels” line 16 “To abandon thriftiness and to be expansive” The MWT edition A omits this line. The MWT edition B keeps the line.\n\nlines 21–22 “When heaven is going to save a person, It will protect him with compassion.” The MWT editions A and B read: “When heaven is going to establish a person, It will fortify him with compassion.”\n\nChapter 68\n\nlines 7–8 “This is called the power of using people. This is called the match of Heaven, the ultimate of the Ancients.” The MWT edition A reads: “This is called using people. This is called Heaven, the ultimate of the Ancients.” The MWT edition B reads: “This is called using people. This is called the match of Heaven, the ultimate of the Ancients.”\n\nChapter 69\n\nlines 7–8 “To confront the enemy as if without one. To grasp war weapons as if without them.” These lines are reversed in the MWT editions A and B: “To grasp war weapons as if without them. To confront the enemy as if without one.”\n\nChapter 70\n\nline 5 “My words have their root; my deeds have their lord.” This line in the MWT edition A reads: “My words have their lord; my deeds have their root.” But in the MWT edition B, the order is the same as the present translation.\n\nChapter 71\n\nThe MWT edition A renders the whole chapter as follows:\n\nHe who knows that he does not know is the best.\n\nHe who does not know that he does not know is sick.\n\nTherefore, the Sage is without sickness\n\nBecause he realizes that sickness is sickness.\n\nTherefore, he doesn’t have any sickness.\n\nThe MWT edition B renders the chapter in this way:\n\nHe who knows that he does not know is the best.\n\nHe who does not know but pretends to know is sick.\n\nTherefore, the Sage is without sickness\n\nBecause he realizes that sickness is sickness.\n\nTherefore, he doesn’t have any sickness.\n\nChapter 73\n\nline 5 “Even the Sage would find it difficult.” The MWT editions A and B omit this line.\n\nChapter 75\n\nline 8 “Because the man on top strives for a rich life” The Okada and MWT editions A and B read: “Because they strive for a rich life”\n\nChapter 76\n\nline 7 “While the supple and weak are disciples of life” The MWT edition B agrees with this translation, but edition A reads: “While the soft, weak, tiny, and small are disciples of life”\n\nlines. 10–11 “The strong and large are subordinate; The soft and weak are superior.” The MWT edition A reads: “The strong and large stay below; The soft, weak, tiny, and small stay above.” The MWT edition B reads: “Therefore, the strong and large stay below; The soft and weak stay above.”\n\nChapter 77\n\nline 1 “Perhaps the Tao of heaven . . . “ The MWT edition B agrees with this translation, while the MWT edition A reads: “Perhaps the Tao of the world . . . “ line 10 “Who can supply the world with overabundance?” The MWT editions A and B read: “Can those who have possessed excesses supply heaven with their overabundance?” line 12 “Therefore the Sage acts without exalting his ability.” The MWT editions A and B read: “Therefore the Sage acts without possession.”\n\nChapter 78\n\nline 2 “ . . . nothing can surpass it” The MWT editions A and B read: “ . . . nothing can overtake it” lines 4–5 “Use weakness to overcome strength. Use softness to overcome hardness.”\n\nThe MWT edition A reads: “The soft overcomes the hard; The weak overcomes the strong.” The MWT edition B reads: “Water overcomes the hard; And the weak overcomes the strong.”\n\nChapter 80\n\nlines 2–5 “Let the people have tenfold and one-hundredfold of utensils, But never make use of them. Let the people weigh death heavily And have no desires to move far away.” The MWT editions A and B read: “Let those who possess tenfold and one-hundredfold of power over men never use it. Let those who weigh death heavily have intent to move away.” lines 13–14 “Secure in their homes, Happy with their customs” The MWT editions A and B read: “Happy with their customs, Secure in their homes”\n\nChapter 81\n\nlines 3–6 “One who is good will never argue; One who argues is not good. One who knows does not know all; One who knows all does not know at all.” The MWT editions A and B read: “One who knows does not know all; One who knows all does not know at all. One who is good never possesses much; One who possesses much is never good.”"

      "title": "Selected Bibliography",
      "content": "SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nThis selected bibliography consists of three parts. Part I, “The Main References,’’ includes Wang Pi’s version of the Tao Te Ching and his commentary on it, as well as other commentaries on Wang Pi’s commentary and important works on the Tao Te Ching referred to or quoted in this translation. The second part, “Other Chinese Books and Articles,” includes publications written by Chinese, ancient and modern, who in rendering annotations, commentaries, compilations, explanations, explications, interpretations, notes, and revisions of the Tao Te Ching and of Wang Pi’s commentary have greatly enriched the meaning of Taoism. The third part, in addition to general references, also includes translations of Lao Tzu’s Tao Te Ching, mostly by Western scholars whose cultural orientations often bring a perspective quite different from that of Chinese translators.\n\nThe books and articles listed here present only a part of all of the works available on the Tao Te Ching which I have read or consulted. It is impossible to include them all in this bibliography, but perusal of them has kept me constantly alert to the wide range of possible interpretations of the text.\n\nThe richness of resources for the study of Lao Tzu can bring problems as well as stimulation. The name for example, has been romanized in such different ways as Lao-tsi, Lao-tze, Lao-tzu, Lao-tzyy. This translation uses Lao Tzu to refer to the person and Lao Tzu to refer to the book (also referred to as the Tao Te Ching) unless it is used in a direct quote.\n\nAnother problem concerns the dates of ancient Chinese scholars. It is important to understand the historical setting in which ancient materials were written to interpret their contents. However, ascertaining these dates is, to quote a Chinese proverb, like recovering a needle from the bottom of the sea (hai ti lao chen). The search is laborious, if not entirely futile. Friends and relatives who are librarians often have only their sympathy to offer. If the reader remembers that Lao Tzu lived about 2,500 years ago, and all commentators of his work from Wang Pi to the present have spanned a period of seventeen centuries, he can understand why so much is buried in the dust of history. According to the Chinese, however, a man lives in his publication. If his book survives, when he actually lived or died is immaterial.\n\nI. THE MAIN REFERENCES\n\nCh’en, Chu.
