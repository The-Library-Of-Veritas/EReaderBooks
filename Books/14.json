My account of global relational egalitarianism builds heavily on Elizabeth Anderson’s theory of democratic equality. Volker Gerhardt has directed my philosophical attention to the role of the individual person and Philip Kitcher has strengthened my belief in the possibility of progress; both have been invaluable teachers and supporters.\n\nFurthermore, I am extremely grateful for the philosophical inspiration, advice, support and feedback I received in one form or another from many people over the years of working on this text.

			"content": "<align=\"center\"><size=h1><b><cspace=-0.065em>Introduction: The challenge. Global injustice and the individual agent</cspace></b></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nThe world we live in is unjust. A just world would not feature a distribution of resources wherein a few of the richest people control massive, even increasing amounts of wealth—while large numbers of people live in dire poverty. Nor would a just world feature thousands of people dying every day from unsanitary living conditions, or easily preventable diseases. Nor would so many people suffer oppression, exploitation, and exclusion from the decision making processes that have a significant impact on their lives. A just world would not be one in which nearly all of the women who die as a result of childbirth are from low- and middle-income countries; nor one in which excessive consumption of natural resources in the Global North has led to negative environmental outcomes such as a changing climate severely affecting those living elsewhere, not to mention future generations; nor one in which people seeking to flee war, persecution, deprivation or disaster are often denied access to security, are sent back, or knowingly kept in places where their basic rights are violated. And a just world would clearly not be one in which many of these forms of inequality and injustice, despite of some significant improvement and progress, appear to be on the increase due to such diverse reasons as ongoing unfair trade regulations, rising nationalism and supremacism, ongoing environmental pollution, and so on. This list of injustices reigning in today’s globalised world—with its unprecedented international connections and interactions, and movements of people, knowledge, capacities, goods and capital across national borders—could, alas, be further extended.\n\nObviously, existing political and institutional structures on the national and international level have, so far, failed to address these injustices in an adequate way. The persistence and severity of such inequities in the face of institutional shortcomings thus raise the vexing yet unavoidable question of whether other agents, such as individual people, must step in and do something about them. From the combined perspective of political and moral philosophy, one would then have to ask, what is demanded of individual moral agents given the current unjust conditions of our globalised world? With a narrower focus on a specific group of individuals, the question would be: What should the rather well-off, conscientious citizens of the prosperous countries do about current injustices?\n\nGiven the urgency of the challenge and the insufficient responses of institutional agents this question may appear obvious: of course, someone, including individual people, has to do something about these massive injustices. Yet, this answer suggests a perplexing connection between extremely large and complex global challenges on the one hand, and the smallest unit of agency, single individuals, on the other. It will be the task of this book to explore the complicated and problematic link between the possibilities of individual agency and urgent need to address global, structural injustices. In it, I reconsider and reassess pertinent normative values, rules and principles that can be deployed to determine the content of individual responsibility in the global context. And I contend that the moral demands for advantaged and privileged individuals like ordinary citizens living in relative security and affluence in the countries of the Global North are more stringent than the prevailing, rather lenient views suggest.\n\nThis exploration thus has both practical and theoretical facets. Practically, the question is: What should advantaged individual agents do in the face of massively unjust global structures that clearly favour their material interests and secure their privilege? This practical question, however, turns on a prior, more theoretical one: how should one reason about individual moral responsibility for globally unjust circumstances? The focus of this book on cosmopolitan responsibility will be primarily on the theoretical side and explore and defend from the perspective of moral and political philosophy a possible theory of cosmopolitan responsibility and discuss several challenges for such a theory. Yet, this is done with the conviction that a better understanding can also inform and inspire adequate action and reform.\n\nThe distinctive focal point of this book is thus the individual person, seen simultaneously as a needy human being and a bearer of rights on the one hand, and as an active moral agent who is subject to moral demands on the other. As agents, humans are capable of acting with reference to normative concepts, concepts that can also be employed to evaluate the moral quality of a person’s actions. Making progress in addressing injustices and promoting justice will, on the side of individual agents, inevitably also require self-scrutiny and a critical examination of one’s own life in the social and global context.\n\nThe idea of moral cosmopolitanism—i. e. the egalitarian and universalist assumption that each human being is equally morally relevant and that all human beings form a morally relevant community—provides the normative starting point for my exploration of the role and responsibilities of individual agents in the contemporary global context. I will pay particular attention to the attitudes moral agents should develop in response to global injustices if they accept the basic assumption that all human lives are of equal moral importance. This is a normative and pragmatic inquiry into a cosmopolitan, egalitarian ethos, understood as a set of values, norms and concepts that shapes how individuals feel, think, talk and act about global issues in an interconnected world. Such an analysis of the moral and political roles and responsibilities of individual agents in an unjust world contributes to an account of global political ethics, understood as a ‘bottom up’ complement to the ‘top down’ accounts of global institutional justice. Offering the analysis of individual responsibility as a complement, not a replacement, thus does not curtail the importance of institutional responsibility. Often, only structural, top-down reform—through laws, regulations, financial incentives and penalties and so forth—can bring lasting change. Nevertheless, structural change will not occur unless a sufficient number of committed individuals credibly demand such reform.\n\nThree central ideas that I will explore and defend in this book inform and guide my thinking. First, the extensive degree of interconnection, interaction and interdependency among countries, institutions, and people around the world make it impossible to focus only on the immediate environment of any individual moral agent when assessing the moral quality of any act. While it is uncontroversial to state that the reality of globalisation and the factual ‘circumstances of cosmopolitanism’ fundamentally shape the contemporary global order, I will argue that cosmopolitanism should feature in our normative understanding of how we as moral agents ought to conduct ourselves within that order, as well. This is particularly important since the advantage of some is frequently connected with the disadvantage of others through the dynamics of structural injustice. Acknowledging not only the reality of the circumstances of cosmopolitanism but also the ideal of moral cosmopolitanism precludes focussing on narrow frames; instead it entails expanding the circle of moral concern to all members of the global order, connected in one way or another—a move that may carry with it dramatic implications for the sphere and content of our responsibilities.\n\nThe second idea is that discomfort, indignation, and outrage are appropriate responses towards what appears to count as the “normal,” “inevitable,” even “acceptable” background conditions of the lives of the well-off citizens in the industrialised, democratic, high-income countries of the Global North. Often enough, the privileged turn a blind eye to unjustified inequalities and structural injustices, consider them to be remote or perhaps regrettable facts of our world, but essentially unconnected to their lives.1 Instead of indifference and complacency, a significant, uncomfortable but “healthy dissatisfaction with the familiar” (Nagel 1991, 8) is urgently needed. The presumably normal but dramatically unjust “background conditions” (Young 2006b, 120) of the radically unequal world we inhabit provide a morally repugnant context for all of our actions. This background must be acknowledged to have a bearing on any moral assessment of what we do, as well as of what we fail or refuse to do.2\n\nThird, I am persuaded that individual agents and their actions do matter on a global scale, even if global problems and challenges appear overwhelmingly large, complex and numerous. But—as I will argue—individuals have more options than engaging in isolated single acts: they can also become politically active, inform and coordinate with others; they can inspire, call for, and work to bring about collective and institutional change, reform and action that are consistent with cosmopolitan values. This is done best, I argue, by fostering and developing an egalitarian and cosmopolitan ethos to guide one’s thought, action and commitment to others in one’s potentially global social environment. Ultimately, I do not call for selected transactional contributions to addressing injustice, but for transformational change in how agents think, feel, and respond to it. Indeed, a crucial weakness of the current debate about global justice may well be its failure to sufficiently address the role of individual agents necessary to counterbalance and complement institution-based accounts. After all, the commitments and actions of numerous individuals—ordinary citizens, political activists and official leaders alike—inform and shape existing institutions and the creation of new ones; and, under conditions of institutional shortcomings, ineffectivity or even outright failure, individuals are called upon and become primary subjects of moral demands. These considerations raise rather than diminish the importance and fundamental role of individual agents. Thus, besides political philosophy, moral philosophy has to play a central role in the global context as well. In combining these two dimensions of practical philosophy, my proposed theory of cosmopolitan responsibility3 should be read as a contribution to a global political ethics.\n\nThree main theoretical influences shape my proposal: an analysis of structural injustice and its implications for determining the role and responsibilities of individuals in this context in the tradition of Young (2011); relational theories of equality (Scheffler 1993, Anderson 1999, Scheffler 2015), deployed in a modified form to explore the nature of moral obligations that extend beyond the domestic frame to the global scale; and pragmatic accounts of ethics and their assumptions about normative pluralism, the importance of habits and social dynamics, and the possibility of moral and social progress (Dewey and Tufts 1932, Dewey 1939, Kitcher 2011).\n\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>1 The ‘circumstances of cosmopolitanism’</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nIn the past, most human beings lived without detailed knowledge about (or even an awareness of) different cultures in far away regions. Today, by contrast, only few human beings remain detached from the forces of global communication, trade and politics. Indeed, the contemporary world, more than ever before, is characterised by a dense set of intensive connections and interactions among individuals and institutions very nearly everywhere (Widdows 2011; 5, 271). Moreover, even those very few with little or no direct exposure to the modern technological world are now nonetheless affected by it, notably through diffuse phenomena such as environmental pollution and climate change. Even isolated, non-industrial societies living deep in uncharted areas of the Brazilian rainforest, for example, cannot escape the consequences of changing weather patterns. The consequences of global trade, furthermore, affect local markets even in the most remote areas of the world, as the aggregate effect of global consumerism leaves virtually no producer or consumer untouched; global trade and ruthless economic competition have resulted in the creation of “special export zones,” in which workers manufacture often trivial consumer products under inhumane conditions; intellectual property regimes prevent access to essential medicines; famines are aggravated by financial sector speculation on staple foods; illicit financial flows and off-shore business encourages tax evasion which prevents poorer and richer countries alike from providing essential services to their citizens. There are also global events like the soccer world cup that do not only bring people together by providing sports-centered entertainment to a truly global audience. They also create a sphere of global publicity that triggers political discussions ranging from the management of the tournament by its organising institutions, over the diversity of the teams mirroring the history of the country, to the political situation in host countries and the often fraught political relationships between countries.\n\nGlobal interconnectedness and interdependence has reached historically unprecedented levels; it has brought about institutionalised forms of interaction of states and international bodies that cover communication and media, the rules and practices of both local and global business, and people’s leisure activities, travelling, consumer preferences and choices. Such connections, relations and interactions have such a massive and pervasive impact on the lives of people—both positive (advantageous) and negative (limiting)—that they have effectively become unavoidable, as it is neither possible to escape them, nor to be unaffected by them. They are also in an important sense non-voluntary, since no one was asked or able to give prior consent to being subject to such global dynamics. The extensive connections between states, institutions and individuals are thus an inescapable fact, which I call the de facto circumstances of cosmopolitanism or the existing global order (even though I do not mean to insinuate that it is particularly well-ordered). The circumstances of cosmopolitanism are constituted by the multiple, inevitable and highly significant connections between people around the globe.\n\nHowever, the last decades have also brought about many remarkably successful interventions and enlightened developments—even though no achievement is immune to challenges and potential failure. Supranational structures like the United Nations and the European Union continue to evolve to better defend universal rights and basic standards for the treatment of all people (albeit not without an abundance of conflict and new challenges) via the proclamation and progressive realisation of the goals of various instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals. As a result of such developments, for example, a smaller percentage of the world’s population lives under conditions of severe poverty today than at any time before.4 Strides are also being made in cooperation to combat climate change, with the results of the COP21 meeting in Paris in late 2015 being something of a breakthrough for being at least partially legally binding—even though the current global political climate at the time of writing these lines poses significant new threats to the achieved agreements.\n\nIn fact, despite some progress, existing institutions and patterns of interaction have yet to achieve substantial and enduring improvements for the billions of people who continue to live in extreme deprivation and/or continue to be unjustly dominated by others. This type of injustice, as Iris M. Young characterises it, and the morally alarming persistence of the unequal distribution of new benefits and costs, qualifies as an instance of structural injustice (Young 2011). It takes a very particular form:\n\n> Structural injustice exists when social processes put large categories of persons under a systematic threat of domination or deprivation of the means to develop and exercise their capacities, at the same time as these processes enable others to dominate or have a wide range of opportunities for developing and exercising their capacities. Structural injustice is a kind of moral wrong distinct from the wrongful action of an individual agent or the willfully repressive policies of a state. Structural injustice occurs as a consequence of many individuals and institutions acting in pursuit of their particular goals and interests, within given institutional rules and accepted norms. (Young 2006b, 114)\n\nIt is important to emphasise that this disadvantaging of a sizeable proportion of humanity is the collateral result of many agents acting in ways that have been and continue to be widely considered “normal,” “legal,” and even morally unproblematic, such as the powerful pursuit of national interests by political leaders and the pursuit of personal interests by already advantaged individuals.5 Alas, this does not alter the fact that repeated patterns of presumably unproblematic and permissible behaviour within established structures not only secure privilege and advantage but ultimately lead to and perpetuate negative outcomes for vast swathes of humanity. A massive proportion of human disadvantage is not the result of unavoidable causes (like natural disasters), but is anthropogenic, in the sense that it is socially and politically constituted, or could—through coordinated effort—be avoided. Hence, human beings and the social structures they bring about are at the origin of the ongoing disaster of structural injustice in the world.\n\nAcknowledging these ‘circumstances of cosmopolitanism’—including the disastrous global outcomes of structural injustice, created and maintained by normal practices widely regarded as acceptable—is not easy for those enjoying the advantages of security, political stability, and economic prosperity.6 Such acknowledgement would compare and link—partly through a factual, causal connection through interactions; partly through a conceptual connection through the ideal of the equal moral standing of all—the advantages of some with the disadvantages of others. But then, as Nagel has formulated pointedly: “The magnitude of the world’s problems and the inequality in access to its resources produce a weight of potential guilt that may, depending on one’s temperament, require considerable ingenuity to keep roped down” (Nagel 1986, 190). Yet, most of the rather well-off citizens of affluent countries seem to muster that ingenuity with ease, so that they live their comfortable lives more or less unaffected by feelings of complicity with or responsibility for the unjust structures that enable or perpetuate their privilege. The core challenge put forward in this book is to make some progress in understanding the role and responsibilities of individuals in light of the disastrous background conditions just described.\n\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>2 The idea of cosmopolitanism</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nA guiding normative idea of this book is to understand human beings as “cosmopolitans”, as citizens of the world. The fact that all human beings today live in a highly interconnected world makes them, nolens volens, members of a jointly shared system of interaction: everyone is a member of the global order (even if, once again, its dysfunctions and inherent structural injustices make the use of the term “order” here rather less than a literal one). First developed in early Greek philosophy, the idea of “world citizenship” designated the very idea that all human beings are bound together as equals in spite of the differences between groups and individuals and jointly form a morally relevant community. Initially largely idealistic, the increasing interconnections across the globe today have made it more obvious than ever before that there is indeed some form of a factual global sphere of mutual influence and community of which all human beings are members. A moral account of cosmopolitanism is hence based on two assumptions: that each human being is of equal moral standing; and that the morally relevant community includes all humans. This ideal can be used to assess states of affairs from a normative perspective, and to morally demand particular acts and institutional arrangements: It first states the interconnected global reality (circumstances of cosmopolitanism); it then diagnoses several moral flaws in the current global order, based on the moral view that, even in the absence of an actual world-state, every member of the human community is entitled to being respected and treated as a moral equal; and it then assigns cosmopolitan responsibilities to individual and institutional agents.\n\nUnlike other contributions based on the cosmopolitan commitment to equality and universality, my focus here is not so much on giving detailed advice about concrete practices and actions of individuals (e. g. Singer 2009), nor on an analysis of the political dimension of cosmopolitanism (e. g. Hahn 2017) or specific recommendations for institutional reform (e. g. Wenar 2016, Neuhäuser 2018, Cabrera 2018). Instead, I will take a step back and approach cosmopolitanism as a distinctive big-picture moral outlook with implications for the morally demanded underlying ethos that should inform an individual agent’s feelings, thoughts, and actions. This approach is based on the idea that it is possible to promote and implement the cosmopolitan ideal not only from top down but also from the bottom up: cosmopolitanism can then start being realised ‘within borders,’ such as in an agent's direct, local sphere of influence or in one country or a federation of countries that are willing to take a lead.7 Individual agents can integrate global thinking into their local action; and institutional agents can already respect their global responsibility in their confined sphere of influence.\n\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>3 Towards a global political ethics</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nThe ongoing scholarly debates about global justice are rich and manifold. They include normative discussions about the existing global institutional order, about the establishment and regulation of fair trade relationships between nations, about corporate social responsibility of multinational companies, about what constitutes a just distribution of benefits and burdens between different global players, about the conditions for just war, and about possible limits of state sovereignty, particularly with regard to the control of borders, but also with regard to the right or duty of states to intervene to assist citizens in other countries, regardless of sovereign prerogative or cost to the intervening countries (cf. e. g. Brock and Moellendorf 2005, Brock 2013). These are very important debates. Most of the participants in these debates, however, adopt Rawls’s lead8 in largely ignoring the role of the individual when it comes to matters of justice, which he initially proposed could only be an emergent feature of the political and social institutions of a liberal society. According to Rawls, justice is “the first virtue of institutions” (Rawls 1999b, 3), and the individual is, as a result, accorded only a minor role in his theory of justice. A similar marginalisation of the role and responsibility of the individual has dominated the debates about global justice.\n\nIt is not that I object to a focus on institutions or states in the debate about (global) justice. It is clearly appropriate and necessary to elaborate on institutions, interstate interaction and global structures, especially when these are causally implicated in the generation and maintenance of structural injustice and where institutional reform constitutes the most effective, maybe even the only way to eventually overcome structural injustices. But Rawls notwithstanding, it must not be ignored that, ultimately, institutions are not “natural kinds” existing independently of human beings. Instead, they are created by people, frequently with the intention to better fulfill what they deem to be important tasks. Ultimately, individuals shape institutions and social structures, and continue to fill them with life and spirit—for better or for worse. This, in turn, implies that the ethos of people—i. e. their normative commitments and ambitions that shape their dispositions and habits of feeling and thinking, talking and acting—has a significant impact on the existence and functioning of institutions. Individuals also exercise influence on the social norms that govern behaviour and on the (politically and morally relevant) ideas that exist in a group.\n\nThus, I suggest to direct, in questions about global justice, particular attention to the potential role of individual moral agents, and both the direct and the indirect effects of their behaviour.9 This will, I contend, open potentially fruitful avenues for analysing their responsibilities and guiding their attitudes and actions. My inquiry into the role and responsibilities of individual moral agents in an interconnected, unjust world is not meant to replace, but to complement debates over global institutional justice. It brings into consideration this neglected level of global political ethics, the level of individual agency. It requires individuals to accept responsibility, acknowledges and discusses challenges, but concludes with empowering arguments for the importance of individual engagement under current conditions of injustice.\n\nEven though the focus of this work is clearly on the individual’s role in the face of global injustice, I do not mean to imply that comprehensive solutions to global injustice are likely to flow from isolated instances of individual action alone. Cooperative and collective action, and a smart division of the moral labour, ultimately involving institutional agency in the right way, are still necessary. However, all agents are also individually subject to moral demands, and bear personal responsibility to promote the changes necessary to fight existing injustice and advance egalitarian justice globally. In the absence of adequate institutions and in the absence of an ethos of cosmopolitan responsibility, the chances for genuine egalitarian progress appear limited, even grim. But individuals can start and continue making a credible case for change and reform to promote justice; they can, through their acts, also inform and influence others, and this is the best possible way forward for individuals to contribute to addressing and possibly eventually overcoming the massive wrongs that dominate our world.\n\nSuch individual dispositions matter particularly in time of crisis where suddenly the established order and patterns of conduct are questioned and become fragile. The ideas that are in the air at a time of crisis can then be taken into account, guide action, inspire and inform reforms and thus shape the future. It is the important task of individuals to keep the right ideas alive and available, especially under adverse conditions, so that they are at hand when the opportunity arises to deploy and implement them on a larger scale.\n\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>4 The pragmatic impulse</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nThe ideas expressed in this book take up several impulses from the tradition of US-American pragmatism, found notably in the writings of Dewey. Most importantly, a pragmatist perspective on ethics emphasises a moral outlook characterised by three elements that I take to be central to my task: an emphasis on the individual agent (and his or her habits) in social contexts as the core concern of morality; preference for a pluralist method of moral inquiry over the defense of any narrow set of criteria, principles or conclusions; and a resolute optimism that moral and social progress is possible.\n\nMany current global issues—such as inequality and world poverty, climate change and the unjust dynamics in the global economy—are also distinctively moral challenges resulting from and influencing the actions and experiences of persons. It is the habitual actions of individual agents, the things we do day after day (including seemingly trivial consumer decisions or travel preferences), that are at the root of many global problems related to structural injustice.10 Morality, in the pragmatist tradition, stresses the importance of constantly evaluating, re-evaluating, and intentionally shaping our habits, based on moral insight drawn from the full spectrum of sources, rather than from any single normative theory, which, for Dewey at least, would be too limited to be of much practical service. Moral decision-making is complex and multi-faceted, both for individual agents considering their obligations, and for answering the questions of what better political and institutional arrangements would look like, and which actions are likely to help bring about such arrangements. My approach is focussed on the careful cultivation of appropriate habits as a method for ongoing practical reasoning, moral decision making, and action about the current global challenges.\n\nFollowing Kitcher (2011), I regard reflections about all forms of individual ethical conduct to be inherently embedded in the larger “ethical project” of living together in an ever larger, now truly global community of human beings on this planet. I contend that the ideals of cosmopolitan responsibility must ultimately translate into “a personal way of individual life” in light of the reality and nature of globalised human relations. Such a “personalisation” includes:\n\n> the possession and continual use of certain attitudes, forming personal character and determining desire and purpose in all the relations of life. Instead of thinking of our own dispositions and habits as accommodated to certain institutions we have to learn to think of the latter as expressions, projections and extensions of habitually dominant personal attitudes. (Dewey 1939, 226)\n\nSuch an account invites a politisation and “ethicisation” of daily life, a change from the assumed innocence and amorality of ordinary behaviour. While it does not require us to be always and exclusively concerned with moral considerations, it charges all our actions with an ethically relevant dimension. Yet, pragmatic ethics does not stop with such a focus on individual agency: it points to the need to structure the political and social environment in a way that it both reflects the considered normative commitments of people and facilitates individual behavior that aligns with these commitments. Individual behaviour thus has a public and political dimension; and democratic structures inform and shape individual behaviour. Making intelligent use of these dynamics thus can facilitate moral and social progress in the form of structural change.\n\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>5 Overview</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nThis book confronts the pressing question about the role and responsibility of individual agents in an unjust world. I consider this to be among the defining moral, political and philosophical challenges of our time. It would be folly to suggest that a single book, let alone this one, could once and for all settle such an issue. Instead, I only hope to offer some routes for morally reflective individuals to consider as they attempt to navigate the difficult terrain surrounding the question of how to act in the face of global structural injustice.\n\nWith this aim, the book proposes a theory of cosmopolitan responsibility to analyse and determine the role and the responsibility of individual agents in the context of global structural injustice. This theory lies at the intersection of moral and political philosophy and can be called a global political ethics. Concretely, it consists of an account of a cosmopolitan ethos, i. e. a set of ideas, values and commitments that can shape how individuals feel, think, talk and act about global issues in the local context they find themselves in. This cosmopolitan ethos, with its three central elements—the idea of world citizenship; a commitment to global relational egalitarianism; and a pragmatic understanding of ethics, action and habit—is presented in part I. The ethos is elaborated further in part II with the help of three important challenges that can appear once one starts weighing options for action out of the cosmopolitan ethos: the problem that individual acts may be too small to generate any relevant impact on global issues; the tension between universal obligations towards all and special obligations towards some particularly near and dear to us; and the danger of inevitable failure because cosmopolitan obligations exceed what is humanely possible.\n\nChapter one offers a historical and conceptual overview about the idea of cosmopolitanism in its different diagnostic and normative forms in Western philosophy from antiquity to the 20th century. While the first half of chapter one is more historical, the second half introduces important contemporary concepts and discussions, such as about the scope of justice, the universalist and particularist poles of the debate, different metrics and patterns of justice, and the notion of structural injustice. It concludes with an outlook on global political ethics with reflections on the relationship of individuals and institutions, the division of labour in society, and the possibility of fostering an egalitarian ethos.\n\nChapter two considers the basic notion of equality that lies at the heart of the present analysis. I compare and contrast distributive and relational accounts of egalitarianism, both on the domestic and the global level. Ultimately, I argue for global relational egalitarianism as the best account to capture the fundamental commitments of cosmopolitan responsibility. This view understands equality as a lived practice, something we do, not as a static state of affairs or pattern of distribution. It demands, negatively, that oppression, domination, exploitation, marginalisation, exclusion, etc. have to end; and it demands, positively, that equality must reign in all possible and actual interactions and relationships. This understanding of the ideal of equality also has normative implications for individual behaviour and will thus inform my further arguments about the way how individual agents should respond to issues of global inequality and injustice.\n\nChapter three brings into relief some impulses from the philosophical tradition of American pragmatism which underlie and inspire my account of cosmopolitan responsibility, such as the possibility to integrate normative values into the individual and collective “way of life”, the importance of habits over single acts, and an optimistic belief in the possibility of social and moral progress. Pragmatism also assigns philosophy a modest but constructive role in addressing problems and identifying solutions to facilitate and improve the living together of all.\n\nIn advancing the moral ideal of cosmopolitanism, the theory of global relational egalitarianism and the pragmatic perspective, part I will provide the normative groundwork for my theory of cosmopolitan responsibility that can be integrated in the personal ethos of individual agents.\n\nPart II moves on to weighing action. Its three chapters discuss three pressing challenges that arise once agents endorse and attempt to act out of the cosmopolitan ethos, presented in part I. How does individual action matter? Does cosmopolitan responsibility leave room for any preferential treatment of those particularly near and dear to us? And: Can we ever hope to live up to the apparently excessive demands of cosmopolitan responsibility?\n\nChapter four addresses the tension between the large size of problems of global injustice and the inevitably very small impact of individual agency: Given this discrepancy, any agent weighing different reasons for action will wonder whether her actions will matter at all; and whether they will be able to generate any meaningful impact. The chapter discusses several ways in which even single acts of individual agents matter morally: as small contributions to large harm; as small triggers that can set of a cascade of events; or as contributions that (even if they make only a negligible difference to addressing a complex global problem) make a very big difference for some who are affected by a complex global problem. To conclude, the chapter introduces Young’s social connection model to explain how not only single acts, but particularly repeated patterns of individual action matter in contexts of structural injustice. It identifies several criteria that can help determine the content of individual responsibility. The results reached in this chapter will be taken up and expanded further in the concluding chapter of the book.\n\nIn chapter five, I address the puzzle of partiality, an important and practically relevant objection against an account of cosmopolitan responsibility. This puzzle is based on the tension between universal, impartial demands on the one hand, and partial, more immediate demands on the other. This challenging tension becomes palpable once individuals consider everyone as a being of equal moral standing, while still feeling a special commitment or obligation towards some that are particularly near and dear. This tension is difficult to solve: even if impartiality always matters morally, it clearly is not all that matters morally. The chapter discusses the grounds for special obligations and preferential treatment for oneself, for one's intimates, and also for one's compatriots. I argue that relationship-dependent reasons for preferential treatment, as they result from personal connections, have some genuine moral weight that can render some degree of preferential treatment morally permissible. Membership-dependent reasons for preferential treatment, however, as they result for example from shared nationality, cannot claim to have similar moral force: if not all have equal access to the relevant communities, that are not shaped by close interpersonal relations, preferential treatment of the in-groups comes at the morally unjustifiable expense of those who are excluded.\n\nHowever, even in the case of well-justified and permissible forms of preferential treatment within special relations, the universal and impartial reasons can never be fully eliminated. Thus, a tension between the two incommensurable standpoints of partiality and impartiality will inevitably persist, at least under conditions of massive inequality. Consequently, morality as such does not appear as an integrated and comprehensive whole but as a fragmented set of competing perspectives and values, that renders the possibility of successfully navigating through mutually exclusive demands dubious.\n\nChapter six pursues this insight further by addressing the moral overdemandingness objection: cosmopolitan responsibility might generate impossible moral requirements if, under current conditions, weighty and non-negotiable moral requirements (that are able to pass an interpersonal justification test) bind agents, no matter whether they are actually capable of acting upon them. The chapter critically reviews different possible strategies to ease the moral burden that results from a cosmopolitan extension of moral concern. But arguments for reducing the moral burden of individual agents to what they consider not excessively demanding and/or feasible is not the only option. Alternatively, one could accept that it is impossible, under current conditions of extreme inequality and injustice, to live a fully moral live. In the second half of the chapter I explore and defend this second option, however much more controversial and much less appealing it may be. Yet, taking the needs and unmet basic rights of the disadvantaged seriously deserves priority over worrying about the moral innocence of the advantaged. Thus, I propose a qualified account of impossible moral imperfection, even failure, that distinguishes its objective, diagnostic dimension from its subjective and intersubjective dimensions. Generally, it should not count as a flaw of any (sufficiently demanding) moral theory if it places apparently excessive moral burdens on those who could, in principle, act. Instead, such overdemandingness rather indicates a flaw of the world that needs to be corrected.\n\nThe critical reflections of part II—on the limits of individual agency in a global context, on the puzzle of partiality and on moral overdemandingness—elaborate my understanding of the role and responsibility of individual agents in the face of global structural injustice: As morally equal citizens of the world, agents aspire to contribute to realising global relational equality. Committed, from a pragmatic persepective, to normative pluralism, and equipped with a firm belief in the possibility of progress, they understand that their direct impact will inevitably be limited. But even apparently tiny contributions might matter, particularly if they are repeated over long periods of time and if they start to spread, influence behaviour of others, shape ideas and consolidate themselves in institutions. Clearly, the social and epistemic networks that today connect people across the globe will not only impose limits to unconstrained preferential treatment for oneself and for those particularly near and dear; it will also make moral perfection unavailable under current conditions. But acknowledging these unpleasant realities can motivate responsible cosmopolitan agents to take pride in contributing—through concrete and often local action out of global thinking—to realising a world in which the circumstances are such that global structural injustice ceases to exist; in which everyone's basic needs and interests are fully met; and in which, consequently, preferential treatment for some becomes less problematic and moral failure, in the sense analysed, can be avoided.\n\nIn this spirit, the book concludes with a chapter on the ethos of cosmopolitan responsibility. The adequate response of individual agents to global injustice consists in developing an egalitarian, cosmopolitan ethos that informs and influences one's way of feeling, thinking, talking and acting about injustice. Given the pervasive nature of global structural injustice, promoting an egalitarian ethos—in individuals and groups—would be, I contend, a suitable contribution to addressing the distinctive wrong of pervasive structural injustice from the side of individuals. An ethos links the cognitive-rational, the socio-emotional and the dispositional-behavioural dimensions of a person and thus does not only trigger small direct (‘vertical’) action to address injustice; it also generates indirect (‘horizontal’) effects by communicating one's moral and political commitments to other agents in one's community. No individual in isolation can have a meaningful impact upon the massive and complex challenge of global injustice; but joint normative commitments, shared aims, and coordinated political and systemic action, of which individuals can be part, can generate impact and bring reform.\n\nAs I argue throughout the book, a major shift in perceiving the wrong of injustice is necessary: global problems have to be moved from the periphery of our attention more to the centre; and they have to be conceptualised as challenges that must not be left to ineffective or inexistent institutions: they require responses from individual moral agents, too. Fostering an ethos of cosmopolitan responsibility with its pervasive impact on how agents feel, think, talk and act does just this.\n\nOf course, for those seeking specific guidance about what to do, my account of cosmopolitan responsibility will most likely appear insufficiently concrete. And obviously, a great number of questions remain unaddressed and unanswered in the following pages. But the goal of my philosophical analysis is—in spite of its ambitious scope and its firm conviction that promoting a cosmopolitan ethos is urgently needed—quite modest: to engage in a conceptual inquiry into the values, norms and principles that can determine and help guide individual responsible action in the global context. Thinking through the issues presented in this book will hopefully provide readers with some thought provoking material to form their own judgements about what to do and then to take responsible action, once that the importance of individual contributions to respecting the equal moral importance of all and to addressing global wrongs has been firmly established."

This last chapter combines insights from preceding chapters to conclude the exploration of the role and responsibility of individual agents—with a focus on well-off, ordinary citizens in the countries of the Global North—in the face of global structural injustice. It recapitulates key features of a theory of cosmopolitan responsibility, which can be, in the form of a cosmopolitan ethos, personally endorsed by individuals and thus shape dispositions and behaviour. Such an ethos is based on a sense of belonging to a broader, morally relevant community of all humans as equals. It acknowledges the multiple political, economic, environmental, social, and cultural relations, interdependencies and interconnections that link the local, the regional, the national and the global levels with one another, making all humans morally equal citizens of the world.\n\nMy considerations may offer some guidance for individuals reflecting on what they should do concretely, but they will not identify precise tasks or specific duties. Given the size and the pervasiveness of structural injustice and its multiple appearances, such ambition would be misguided. Instead, in this book, I argue more generally that the suitable moral response of individuals to structural injustice should consist in developing and fostering an egalitarian ethos of cosmopolitan responsibility that, in overcoming indifference, permeates an agent’s thinking and feeling, informs choices, leads to some action directly tackling injustice but also generates indirect effects on other agents in the community surrounding the agent. Such a cosmopolitan ethos of individuals links cognitive and rational normative analysis, with a socially embedded and emotionally charged feeling of relational equality in the global community, and a disposition to act according to the values of cosmopolitan responsibility.\n\nImportantly, determining individual responsibility in terms of an ethos (instead of identifying concrete duties or tasks) has two main advantages: by avoiding atomistic assessments of single acts, the ethos, first, matches individual attitudes and patterns of behaviour (not single acts) with the distinctive wrong of injustice embedded in structures, and, second, it allows to stress the relational and social components of individual agency. Thus, individual responses are not only to be assessed in terms of their (accumulated) actual and direct (“vertical”) effect on addressing need or increasing justice; they also matter with regard to their (“horizontal”) effect on other agents, i. e. as contributions to the development of a collective ethos providing an important basis for collective action and, possibly, for successful institutional reform of unjust structures. This last chapter further spells out these claims.\n\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>2 Four features of global individual responsibility</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nMy account of cosmopolitan, global individual responsibility is characterised by the following four features: it is inherently personal, pluralist, forward-looking, and pragmatic.\n\nThe essential feature of cosmopolitan responsibility is its personal nature. It contends that individuals are bearers not only of basic rights, but also of responsibilities which correspond to those rights. Several ways of linking individual agents to collective harms and instances of structural injustice have been discussed in the preceding chapters. The fundamental reason for establishing responsibility is—on universalist and egalitarian terms—the existence of relations between persons. Persons are understood as needy and vulnerable beings on the one hand, and as capable agents on the other. Furthermore, they are understood as common members of morally relevant communities within which they are connected through personal and structural interactions.249 In a global community, individuals morally ought to become self-aware about their role and responsibility not only to avoid harm and to remedy harm already caused, but more generally to respect others and secure equality, also by helping to fight moral wrongs and by promoting and securing the rights and flourishing lives of all. The relevant point here is that individuals are called upon to engage in political action and, ideally, work towards structural solutions—even if effectively changing the structures far exceeds their particular capacities. But the impossibility of changing large-scale problems alone does not free anyone from a personal moral obligation to respond to them. Governmental politics and science alone will not fix the problems under discussion unless a sufficient number of persons acknowledge their urgency, call for change, accept some personal responsibility, make use of their capacities, and undertake efforts to address them in one way or another. People within and outside of institutions have to show personal commitment and demand change. Only then will institutional agents—such as corporations, governments or the international community—ultimately feel compelled to take action.\n\nThus, cosmopolitan responsibility, although distinctively individualistic, is certainly not atomistic and does not isolate individuals. On the contrary, it is based on the insight that persons are, as individuals, dependent on others; they live, interact, and flourish in exchange with others. It also acknowledges that the personal responsibility of individual agents may best be discharged by coordinating with others in order to collectively create adequate institutions. The fundamental point is that individuals matter also as individuals; their single acts, over which they have control, are relevant for flagging problems, for starting to address them collectively and for promoting structural reforms. Thus, individuals are—in spite of the limited direct impact their acts may have—personally called upon as bearers of responsibility for the larger structures they live in.\n\nThe moral relevance of such personal involvement with unjust structures can be explained in numerous ways, making the account of cosmopolitan responsibility inherently pluralist. This is its second characteristic. The preceding chapters discussed different forms of entanglement justifying personal responsibility: persons may bear responsibility for their past or ongoing contributions to injustices, they may have a general moral obligation to minimise harm and maximise the good for all, they may have an obligation to foster and develop their own character in a specific way, and they may be required to respect everyone as moral equals in all interactions, including indirect interactions with those temporally or spatially remote. I contend that all these different normative strategies have genuine moral weight, and one should not be forced to give exclusive preference to only one of them. Quite to the contrary, expanding one’s view by acknowledging multiple sources of morality should be seen as an opportunity, not as a burden. Such a broader view not only avoids that one misses important moral dimensions of a problem; it also allows a better appreciation of the richness and complexities of the multiple dimensions of human life; it may also help, if deployed wisely, to mobilise a greater number of moral emotions, thus increasing motivation—in contrast to the somewhat impoverished focus of more narrow moral theories relying on a single, rational criterion alone.\n\nHowever, pluralism has a price: it often comes along with less clear advice than straightforward adherence to a single principle would, particularly because an ‘algorithm’ to calculate and weigh the competing morally significant perspectives and considerations is unavailable. I also doubt that it will be possible to come up with such an algorithm, neatly integrating the different perspectives. Yet, the risks attached to the pursuit of unambiguous normative neatness are greater than those attached to living with plurality: The suggestion of clarity where it does not exist invites activity under the illusion of knowledge and impedes the pursuit of engaging further with the problems at hand instead of pursuing the search for adequate ways of engaging with them.250 Thus, a pluralist account of responsibility will invite and welcome contributions and assessments from different normative perspectives and attempt to identify morally adequate responses in light of obligations, consequences, connections, etc. And in many cases, at least, significant convergence between different normative perspectives will appear: the general wrongs of global structural injustice can be acknowledged by deontic, consequentialist, virtue-based, contractualist, and other approaches alike.\n\nA third feature of cosmopolitan responsibility is its temporal dimension: it assigns priority to the present and the future, not to the past; responding personally to a given global challenge here and now means to specify the general intuition that someone should be doing something about a problem by determining what can and should be done by whom. Here, initially all those who can address a significant moral wrong are included as possible bearers of moral responsibility. In this regard, cosmopolitan responsibility is extremely inclusive and ‘generous’ in assigning such initial, forward-looking responsibility. This is done to limit the possibly negative impact of obsessing about past events and activities and blame-shifting, which can undermine and complicate necessary responses to address a wrong (for example by assigning responsibility only to some while letting others too quickly off the hook).\n\nAssigning priority to the forward-looking perspective, however, is not to be identified with exclusivity: Looking back also matters to some degree, particularly when it comes to distributing burdens among several capable agents in a fair way. Those who have done wrong, caused harms, or through doing so are enjoying particular advantages, bear, and should willingly accept, greater forward-looking responsibilities in acting to address a wrong. The fact that more powerful, privileged agents are frequently unwilling to acknowledge their harmful contributions and instead prefer to engage in blame-shifting, avoid costly remedial action or argue strategically for equal burden sharing is, of course, lamentable. However, it does not speak against the soundness of the normative judgement that past acts generate special responsibilities. But neither does it free other capable agents from their own, past-independent, forward-looking responsibility to address massive moral wrongs today (even if those bearing special responsibility fail to live up to it).\n\nThe fourth characteristic of global individual responsibility is its pragmatic nature. By this I mean a combination of three features: epistemic humility, an optimistic belief in the possibility of progress, and practical ambition.\n\nPluralism, already mentioned above, makes a case not to strive for unambiguousness but instead to use the best available theoretical and practical tools to assess a given challenge and weigh adequate options of response. Acknowledging epistemic limitations—resulting from incomplete factual knowledge on the one hand and selective or narrow perspectives on the other—supports an attitude of modesty in making judgements and in prescribing specific actions. Epistemic modesty then demands a general willingness to hear other opinions, to listen to the voices of all affected, to engage with them on terms of good faith, and to pursue the task of identifying an adequate moral response to a given problem together. Modesty in this regard, however, must not be confounded with a weakened willingness to defend one’s judgements: defending one’s own, well-considered point of view by explaining it with the help of good arguments that are accessible to others, is an integral ingredient for successfully determining appropriate solutions.\n\nThe second pragmatic element is a general yet non-naive optimism, which asserts that progress towards a better future, in which current problems are increasingly being addressed and can eventually be solved, is possible. Taken together with the forward-looking perspective and the call for epistemic modesty, it calls for a wide and inclusive dialogue about what such a better future would entail and what would be necessary to bring it about. It seeks to articulate values and ideas, rights and responsibilities that promote progress by remedying relational inequalities and structural injustice, and by promoting circumstances for flourishing lives for all. And it also remembers past instances of successful progressive change to refute pessimistic or apathy-inducing voices.\n\nPractical ambition, the disposition to transform one’s attitudes, value judgements, and one’s perception of connectedness in a morally relevant community into concrete acts, is a third element of the pragmatic nature of cosmopolitan responsibility. It deserves particular attention and thus will be taken up in the following section.\n\nThese four features—personal, pluralist, forward-looking, and pragmatic—characterise the normative outlook of cosmopolitan responsibility in general terms. Now, the task ahead is for each agent to respond personally by considering his or her role in the problematic structures at hand and by analysing and improving behaviour.\n\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>3 The cosmopolitan ethos</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nThe primary philosophical ambition of this book was to defend the normative outlook of cosmopolitan responsibility by exploring norms, values, and ideals that shape our understanding of the roles and responsibilities of individual agents in a globalised, interconnected world. These normative considerations yield practical relevance when they shape the ethos of an agent; where the ethos is understood as an intra-personal ‘institution’ integrating normative values and considerations in one’s motivational setup, influencing one’s dispositions to act, and thus leading to tangible individual responses to global structural injustice. Importantly, such an ethos can spread beyond what an individual feels, thinks, says and does; it can inform others and invite dispositional and behavioural change in them, too.\n\nTo make sense of this claim and to explain the link between the theoretical, social and behavioural dimensions of moral action, the notion of an ethos required clarification.251 An ethos was understood as a set of values, norms or principles that, held explicitly or implicitly, informs practice. It is an internalised endorsement of values underlying a person's or a group’s way of perceiving and categorising different states of affairs, shaping both the conscious and unconscious responses to specific situations or stimuli, and determining the range of options and actions perceived as appropriate to choose from when confronting an issue. In other words, an ethos shapes people’s ways of feeling and thinking, and their dispositions to communicate and to act about something. In this sense, an ethos is pervasive: it is embedded in the basic setup or character of a person and motivates corresponding action.252 Importantly, however, this setup is neither static nor immune to change. Instead, it can be shaped and developed through such different practices as critical reflection and argumentation, seeing and copying what others do, and, not least, through education, both through factual information and emotional storytelling.253 Inferences about the ethos of a person are possible based on what someone says and does; such visible expressions of an ethos provide information and communicate normative commitments to others in the surrounding social community of an agent, thus generating “horizontal” effects on other agents. In this regard, the personal, i. e. one’s internal commitments shaping observable behaviour, becomes inevitably public and political within a shared social space.\n\nThis description indicates how the ethos as an intra-personal ‘institution’ provides a possible link between the cognitive-rational side of persons, their often emotionally charged relations and social interactions, and their dispositional-behavioural setup, which shapes their actions. The point is that the cognitive dimension, the socio-emotional dimension, and the practical dimension of human lives are not separated from one another, but are closely connected and mutually influence each other. In order to promote lasting dispositional and behavioural change, all these dimensions need to be considered. The focus of philosophical ethics to engage first and foremost with the cognitive rational analysis of normative claims thus is but one part of the full story. Understanding how normativity can actually shape behaviour, and making good use of the psychological dynamics and mechanisms that help people shape and change their behaviour and embrace new, morally superior habits and conduct (both in individuals and in collectives) goes beyond philosophical analysis alone. Here, the analysis of the cognitive dimension should be enriched by paying attention to the social-emotional and dispositional-behavioural dimensions, as well.254 The remaining pages of this book provide further thoughts on the ethos of persons in an attempt to do just this.\n\nBut why bother with apparently idle and idealistic talk about changing an ethos, when any reasonable person has to acknowledge that humans are persistently driven by selfish interests, neglect the legitimate and basic claims of others, and even knowingly accept the suffering and death of others and the deterioration of the environment simply to enjoy some, often rather trivial advantages? Why not give up hope altogether, in light of all the past, obviously unsuccessful attempts to realise a just world, and a current political climate in which populist, nationalist, isolationist and supremacist discourse seems to grow—employing denial, confusion, and blame-shifting strategies to legitimise the continuation of selfish practices and inaction—at the expense of internationalist and cosmopolitan discourse?\n\nAll this has to be seen and acknowledged. And yet: I do not see why it should be impossible that people and policies change, as they have done so often already in the past.255 Things can change for better or for worse, but change they can. The sheer possibility of change—of both progress and deterioration—thus calls upon all morally sensible people to contribute their share; even if it is only small, and even if it faces a quite hostile political climate shaped by denial, parochialism, ineffectiveness, and outright passivity. To counter this, the very privileged are clearly called upon, as are those who occupy positions of influence. Activists leading the fight for change are urgently needed, too. But also ordinary citizens, if they are privileged enough to be able to inform themselves and engage in some form of action, are called upon to use their abilities. Apathy and inaction are simply not morally acceptable options in the face of the massive wrongs that shape our current world, and the impending threat that things will only get worse. Which, then, are the essential features of a cosmopolitan ethos?\n\nAcknowledging problematic connections and relations. The original problem of structural injustice is, as we have seen above, that much of the current global inequalities and injustices are frequently not even perceived as being of concern to the privileged individuals living in the countries of the Global North. The manufacturing conditions of consumer products are at best briefly regretted but ultimately ignored; the pollution resulting from mobility is occasionally lamented but does not lead to sufficient behavioural change; the wealth and security within countries of the Global North is considered as unproblematic and generally justified, so that others are either fully ignored or seen as undeserving or not entitled to equal standards of security and well-being. All this leads to a situation in which the suffering and deprivation of others are conveniently kept hidden from sight, often with the help of walls, fences and force. This set of dispositions is widely shared and can itself also be characterised as an ethos, although as one opposed to its cosmopolitan and egalitarian antithesis: an ethos endorsing a parochial view that insufficiently acknowledges, or even denies, both the existing connections and the equal moral standing of all.\n\nThe alternative cosmopolitan ethos acknowledges the existence of transnational, cosmopolitan relations and connections of all within a global community. These connections have both a factual basis, e. g. in the form of economic interactions, or the transnational effects of the global climate shaping our globalised and interconnected world, but also an ideal basis, i. e. the idea of a morally relevant community of morally equal global citizens who are willing to put themselves in the shoes of others and foster concern for how the lives of others go. In this scenario, indifference and inaction towards the fate of other fellow humans in need are understood as denial and rejection. From the perspective of a cosmopolitan ethos it is imperative to replace this indifference with explicit acknowledgment of a morally relevant relationship. The task ahead consists in seeking to develop that pre-existing, more parochial ethos with its insufficient acknowledgement of the equal moral status and relevance of all into a cosmopolitan ethos. This will move concern for the globally disadvantaged from the periphery more to the centre of people’s concern, calling also for corresponding individual action.\n\nIndividual action in social context. Yet, ending the problems of global structural injustice through individual agency alone will be impossible, as anyone considering acting to address such large-scale challenges will immediately become aware of. Furthermore, when considering the number of important, morally urgent tasks, agents will realise, at least under current circumstances, the difficulties, even the impossibility of always acting in line with the pluralist demands of moral cosmopolitanism that assigns equal moral value to everyone and stipulates morally relevant relations between all within the mutual sphere of influence. So many of our everyday acts are morally tainted, as a critical reflection on consumer decisions, the everyday needs for mobility, or the preferential treatment extended to those near and dear to oneself, clearly indicate. Thus, seeking moral perfection is not a plausible goal. The task for individual agents hence cannot consist in obsessing about keeping one’s hands perfectly clean or always attempting to do everything perfectly right; instead, it consists in making well-considered choices regarding how much one is willing to do, and about how many costs one is willing to accept to promote the good. It forces agents to place themselves on a spectrum of being more part of the problem or more part of the solution. Individual agents can always choose from numerous options, forcing upon themselves an inevitable decision about whether they want to start acting and how far they want to go. But importantly, they can start and improve, right away.\n\nFrom the perspective of cosmopolitan responsibility, the sheer ability to choose from these diverse options—including the morally problematic option to remain inactive—is in itself a vivid indicator of privilege. Such undeserved privilege comes along with additional powers that often remain unappreciated and even undermine the motivation to expand the circle of concern for others. Awareness of this privilege, however, points out how relatively easy it would be, under conditions of security and abundance, to change behaviour and to ask for and promote political reforms. While the globally disadvantaged, if they have a chance to be heard at all, often have to accept immense risks when speaking up against exploitative employers, multinational companies, or oppressive regimes, the possible costs for endorsing a more egalitarian and cosmopolitan mindset as a globally privileged person are rather small, making it, I contend, a matter of simple decency to develop the egalitarian ethos and see to it that it translates into some concrete action.\n\nThe available options for action that individual agents may choose to realise in accordance with the normative outlook of cosmopolitan responsibility are numerous. The problems calling for cosmopolitan concern abound, as do the possibilities to address them, also from the perspective of individual agents. All responses are steps towards reducing the “passive injustice” that consists in inaction.256 Options range from informing oneself and others about the problems to raise awareness; talking about them and taking a stance, both in private settings, such as the family, and in more public settings, for example at work; keeping ideas about alternatives to the current problematic situation ready, developing them further so that they are available at times when they could become effective; practically, agents can aspire to reduce their unintentional involvement in causing harm or upholding injustice; further options include the possibility of donating time or money to organisations actively addressing need and injustice, or even working in or for such organisations; to self-limit one’s own wealth and use of resources and to make ethically considered consumer decisions; and, of course, for those who see this as a good fit for themselves, political, civic or activist engagement—e. g. in the form of inspiring creative, provocative or disruptive, thought stimulating, symbolic action—is also an important option available to most citizens living in the affluent liberal democracies of the Global North (that may even invite and support such engagement).257 Taking the perspective of cosmopolitan responsibility with its commitment to relational equality will encourage privileged citizens of the world to consider such actions and to engage in as many of them as reasonably possible. I do not offer a concrete minimal or a maximal set of obligations, because, in any case, it is impossible to avoid some degree of moral failure or to reach moral perfection (cf. chapter six). Because of the morally disastrous circumstances of structural injustice the privileged cannot hope to be doing enough; moral awareness and sincerity will not cease to demand more as long as others, living under conditions of preventable misery, can be helped. But it seems clear that, from the perspective of cosmopolitan responsibility, most, if not nearly all of the privileged citizens should move these concerns for structural injustice more to the centre of their own and the public attention and should be doing more to address them than they currently do.\n\nChallenges to taking cosmopolitan action. Sure, endorsing a cosmopolitan ethos and displaying the corresponding behaviour frequently causes some friction with and irritation among those who do otherwise; such tensions increase with the consistency and costliness of the non-standard behaviour. Different kinds of counter-arguments and self-defense mechanisms are then advanced in order to justify continuing with the problematic, established patterns of behaviour. Blaming moral agents as naive “do-gooders” is one prominent strategy.258 But—as long as no severe harassment, violence or abuse takes place—the costs incurred for moral decency are of rather limited weight compared to the costs suffered by those whose rights and plights are ignored, and who are often unable to make their voices heard, be it because they are struggling for survival or because they are dominated, threatened or silenced. Here, a general change in norms and in what is considered acceptable behaviour is needed; and there is no reason why such change should not, eventually, be possible—as many instances of progressive change in the past have shown. Each instance of such change started with some people moving first, others contributing, and in doing so setting new trends, while initially also accepting criticism for their unusual behaviour.259\n\nBut how far will a cosmopolitan ethos actually shape agency? Can one ever do enough? Will agents, with the right ethos, have to dedicate their entire lives to addressing global structural injustices or other moral wrongs? Is it still permitted to assign (some) preference to those particularly near and dear to oneself? Clearly, doing more in order to promote the good is, from the moral point of view, always better than doing less, and engaged and committed activism is urgently required. But human lives have many facets and earning one’s living, raising one’s children, and taking care of oneself also matter and command attention. These circumstances may even explain (but not justify) why many people actually do not do more to address global injustice and thus fail to live up to cosmopolitan demands. However, moral concern in thinking about the problems at hand should not primarily be directed to the fate of the privileged individual agents and their concern about the ability to reach moral perfection (cf. chapter six). Instead, it should be primarily directed to the need of the disadvantaged and to the conditions of injustice. From this starting point it has to be asked whether and how it is possible to contribute to changing the circumstances that so negatively impact on so many people’s lives.\n\nIt is one of the distressing truths of this world, that each act has opportunity costs. Thus, even apparently innocent acts, especially under circumstances in which an alternative to reduce injustice or secure rights would be available, have a price—a price born by those whose plight remains unheard, who are not helped. However, it is not my ambition to suggest that all should radically change their lives by suddenly ignore all special relationships and responsibilities and become concerned in a perfectly impartial way exclusively about the global problems at the centre of this book. Few would be impressed by such an argument, no one would follow it.\n\nThe importance of some people dedicating their lives primarily, even exclusively, to fighting injustice is undeniable. Moral progress and social change need such agents willing to incur high costs, take risks and expose themselves. But cosmopolitan responsibility is—on its more modest, realistic and practical side—an ideal accessible and relevant for many more people: everyone morally ought to contribute to the task of increasing justice by integrating awareness of the existing injustice in their everyday decisions and acts. And this demand can be met even if one does not, or does only on occasion, take up the role of a committed activist.\n\nThe focus of the present book was, as indicated in the beginning, on ‘ordinary’ citizens. Their role must not be underestimated. It is crucial for promoting and securing global justice and equality, because some general concern for the problems at hand and a general commitment to addressing them needs to permeate society. To realise this goal, the outstanding acts of the few are important, but the commitment of anyone objecting to the current state of affairs will be imperative, too. And contributing to establishing a broad and sound basis for progress in addressing existing injustices is very well compatible with exercising other roles responsibly: It is possible to be a baker, teacher, bus-driver, parent, etc. and to display an egalitarian ethos that tangibly translates into feeling concern, acknowledging responsibility, talking about connections, and, of course, also taking action—as a political being and engaged citizen, as a consumer, as a friend—in ways that take background injustices into account and contribute to addressing them.\n\nIndividual impact. Focussing on the ethos of people and groups of people, and not prescribing specific acts, is particularly promising in the context of global structural injustice, where the moral wrong in question is itself not constituted by single instances of morally flawed action, but is pervasively embedded in the (global) social structures and the standard patterns of interaction and behaviour. Climate change, economic unfairness and world poverty are important examples. Here, a single instance of a good action (even if it is very much effective in saving or significantly improving the life of one or the lives of a few people) is insufficient to address the general, structural wrong—in the same way as single problematic acts are not at the origin of the structural wrong in question. Correspondingly, only a change in those structures and patterns of action and interaction, both in individual and in institutional agents, can adequately address such wrongs. And while ordinary individuals cannot directly change structures and institutions, they have an impact on the level of other individuals that constitute and shape them.\n\nThus, individual action is in no way futile. Two factors particularly increase the impact of individual behaviour. First, if people do not only act once in a certain way but change their dispositions, patterns and habits of action, this repetition will add up and increase the impact of their acts. Hence, the narrow scope, often dominant in ethics, to assess single acts must be widened so that individual behaviour over longer time-spans, potentially for the duration of an entire life, is taken into account. In this way, cumulative effects can be considered as well. On this account, the effects of individuals can really make a difference; even if unmeasurable on a global scale, they can make a significant difference for some. Second, as social beings, humans are attentive to the behaviour of others and perceive norm deviation—also new, morally improved behaviour—as an irritation that challenges the established patterns of behaviour. Such irritation, the moment in which standard behaviour becomes problematic, often is the beginning of inquiry (cf. above, chapter three, section three). Thus, every instance of it should be seen as a welcome trigger to start a collective reconsideration of current and insufficiently questioned practices, guided by the ambition to realise relational equality for all. Those taking action towards this goal thus influence other possible agents—through irritation, through information—and can contribute to establishing new, better standards of thinking and acting.\n\nOf course, the call for accepting global connectedness and furthering cosmopolitan concern and responsibility seems to run against much of the current of our time. Maybe, in hindsight, the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015, which led to the Paris Agreement, will be considered as a peak of a globally interconnected human civilisation and of the international cooperation that began increasing after World War II. Six months later, the British voted for “Brexit”; five months later, Donald Trump was elected president of the USA; populist movements in many countries further gained in strength and, at the time of writing, an end to the rise of parochialism and nationalism does not appear to be in sight. In the light of such powerful current political developments and the spread of what could be called an anti-cosmopolitan ethos, calling for relational equality and cosmopolitan responsibility might appear irritatingly untimely and naively optimistic. Yet, the isolation of individuals and communities is not a viable option. No matter whether we like it or not, today we live in a global sphere of mutual influence, and mutual effects are inevitable; the circumstances of cosmopolitanism are an undeniable fact of our time. We are all in this together. This makes it imperative to develop and foster a rationally justified, emotionally felt, socially embedded and action-guiding cosmopolitan ethos of responsibility, no matter how bad the current odds stand. Every individual is thus faced with the existential choice of being part of the problem or part of the solution—acknowledging equality, connectedness, and responsibility in what one does.\n\n<align=\"center\"><size=h2><margin=0.75em>4 Citizens of the world</margin></size><align=\"justified\">\n\nIt is time to conclude this book. I set out to analyse the dazzling link between large and complex global structural injustices on the one hand and the smallest unit of agency, the individual person on the other. I inquired into the moral roles and responsibilities of individuals, particularly the relatively well-off ordinary citizens in the affluent countries of the Global North. With my focus on individual behaviour, I have taken a bottom-up perspective to complement the important ongoing debates about global institutional (in‐) justice by providing the outlines of a global political ethics, specifying individual responsibility through an account of a cosmopolitan ethos. This was defended in full awareness of the limited impact most of our individual actions will have. Yet, societies and institutions are set up by people, and they depend on individuals to shape them. Cosmopolitan reforms will take place only if they are demanded, and change thus can start where ultimate moral agency lies: with the individual agent demanding it and working towards it.\n\nBased on the proposition defended above that individual moral agents matter—simultaneously as beings with legitimate needs and claims on the one hand, and as agents able to act according to normative convictions on the other—I have sought to develop the core elements of a cosmopolitan ethos that can and should inform how people respond to the challenge of living together in a global community. This ethos and its normative ideas yield practical relevance by being able to shape everyday habits and actions of individuals and groups. In particular, equality is neither a remote or theoretical ideal, nor a static state of affairs. On a relational account, equality is a practice. It is something agents can do.\n\nIt is my sense that the experience and acknowledgment of the joint co-existence and mutual influence of all on this planet can and ultimately must become transformative. The global sphere of citizenship, and a global civil society, increasingly materialises from rather abstract ideas into a felt reality. The random and arbitrary contingencies that assign everyone a place in the world will then, particularly for all those enjoying privileges and relative advantages, be re-envisioned as merely the position from which they contribute to the perennial moral project of acting responsibly as citizens of the world."
